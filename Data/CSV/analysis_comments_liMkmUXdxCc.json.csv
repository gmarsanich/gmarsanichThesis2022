"For those who felt bad for the fish. It’s a carp. Carp are extremely invasive and take over rivers, lakes, and reservoirs all over the world. Most places make a law or rule where when you catch one of them you terminate it. Some will eat these fish, however, they are known as trash fish. Unless they are cooked absolutely correctly and seasoned the hell out of. I don’t recommend eating them.",-0.765,Negative,0.025000000000000033,Netural,-0.5645545125007629,Negative
