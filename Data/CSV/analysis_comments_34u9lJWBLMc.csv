"It’s so fun watching them again 🤗 At first, I did not understand all the hype about BTS. I was actually scrolling through facebook last year when one of their performance video (Idol) popped up and out of curiosity, I started reading the comments, most we’re actually commenting about feeling bad for RM not receiving much applaud and screaming when his face was shown in the big screen on their performance for Idol. 

Out of curiosity, I searched on YT as to who all the members of the band was (although I’ve been hearing about them but not exactly know them well). I then learned that this band struggled hard, was mistreated and looked down on the industry as they were just from a small company. I vividly remember feeling bad for Jungkook when his burgers was rejected by this TV host. The rest is history, I listened to their music, loved it, and realized the essence of loving myself. As cliched as this may sound, I love how the music of BTS can relieve a bad day. I do not regret becoming an Army, although I haven’t seen an Army bomb in real life yet 😅",0.7966,Positive,0.0592171717171717,Positive,0.4396140575408935,Positive
