My girlfriend broke up with me in August of last year. She said we needed to take a break but she used it as a excuse to break up. After that breakup I heard this song and it’s one of my favorite songs. It has gotten me through a tough time after that.

"We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But no, I ain't too proud

I couldn't be there
Even when I tried
You don't believe it
We do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me
What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?
It's only me
Let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles

"We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But no, I ain't too proud

I couldn't be there
Even when I tried
You don't believe it
We do this every time

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go

You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me
What you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me
What are you gonna do?
It's only me
Let it go

Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away

I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
