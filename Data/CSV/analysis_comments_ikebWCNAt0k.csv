"Origins of music unevidenced. Except it is gift to humanity from God the Creator. Music continues in heaven. Music discontinues in hell. 
Jesus Christ came from heaven to earth for one purpose only - to die on cross for remissions of pre-existing sins of every single person and to resurrect. Jesus Christ providing forgiveness from pre-existing sins for every single person, salvation from eternity in hell and free entry to eternity in heaven for all who repent of sins in Jesus Christ. 
Other side of death is eternity. Eternity in hell where there is no music but wailing and gnashing of teeth. Or eternity in heaven through Jesus Christ and enjoy heavenly music for free.
Penalty of pre-existing sins already paid by Jesus Christ on The Cross. Accept HIM. Repent sins in Jesus Christ name. Be saved from eternal hell. Enter heaven through Jesus and enjoy music.",0.872,Positive,0.1332142857142857,Neutral,-0.3704737722873688,Negative
