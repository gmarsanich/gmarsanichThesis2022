"The thing is Indian market is not homogeneous. Bollywood is not India and India is not Bollywood. India has about 22 official languages and more than 1000 languages that are spoken as mother tongues! Let's just stick to official languages. Of these, four of the languages Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam are the Southern languages. It is an oft repeated lie that Bollywood is the world's largest film industry and it produces more than 1000 films per year. What the Western media does not highlight is that more 500 movies are produced in the South in all the Southern languages. Bollywood produces more than 200 films per year. The rest are produced in Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Bengali, Marathi and other languages. Although Hindi is widely spoken in the North, in South Indian, people like to see content in their own languages, something which only now Netflix and Amazon Prime are beginning to realise. The Southern states are very much behind Bollywood when it comes to packaging and marketing their entertainment. It will be a matter of time before an entertainment corporation rises up to have a YouTube channel that will rival T series in number of subscribers",0.8154,Positive,0.1615384615384615,Positive,-0.4235422313213348,Negative

First, they release a song, then remix it and later lyrical video of the same song and if that video gets hit, they remake that shit after a few years. Releasing 3-5 videos a day just to get more views is a greedy move. T-series has the highest amount of subs just because our country has a huge population and most of them have got their internet in the past few years.

There are very few independent artist. Most are hired for a movie and the singers don't appear in the video. The actors that it was sung for are the subjects of the video. in essence you can think of a bollywood movie as a musical sung by others and not the actors.",-0.2755,Negative,0.1757142857142857,Positive,-0.4314261972904205,Negative
