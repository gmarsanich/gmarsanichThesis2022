"I got my driver's license last week
Por fin obtuve mi licencia
Just like we always talked about
Como solíamos platicar
'Cause you were so excited for me
Quería darte la sorpresa
To finally drive up to your house
Por fin tu casa visitar
But today I drove through the suburbs
Pero hoy conduzco por la calle
Crying 'cause you weren't around
Llorando al no verte pasar

And you're probably with that blonde girl
¿Estás con esa chica
Who always made me doubt
que me hace dudar?
She's so much older than me
Hace que me intimide
She's everything I'm insecure about
Que crezca cada inseguridad
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
Pero hoy conduzco por la calle
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
No podré amar a nadie más

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Sé que no fue perfecto, pero amor así no había sentido
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Y no puedo creer que estarás bien ahora que me he ido
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
No era verdad lo que escribiste acerca de mí
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Dijiste “por siempre”, pero ahora te veré partir

And all my friends are tired
Y todos mis amigos
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
Seguro hartos ya están
I kinda feel sorry for them
¿Y cómo no sentirlo?
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Ellos como yo no te conocerán
Today I drove through the suburbs
Hoy conduciré por la calle
And pictured I was driving home to you

"Here's a rewrite. Suits me more bc I never really been in a relationship.
It would be called 'Lemonade Stand.'


Started a lemonade stand last week.
Just like we always talked about.
You were so excited for me.
To bring the money to your house.
But today I just stood around.
Waiting for customers to come out.
And you probably forgot about me.
Sometimes you make me doubt.
That this friendship was important.
Like the lemonade selling out.
But now I stand around.
Cause how could I ever do anything else.
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't need me to help you with that scheme.
Cause you said together, now I stand alone, selling tea.
And my family is tired of hearing how much I waste.
But I recently got hired to market cupcakes.
Now I just stand around.
Thinking of commercial brands.
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't need me to help you with that scheme.
Cause you said together, now I stand alone, marketing sweets.
Your late.
Your hurt.
Same old lies and the same old stories.
Its always my fault.
Same old stories and same old lies.
(This part goes on a bit. I didn't really know what to do)
And I know you didn't like my ideas but you were always there for me.
And how can you feel so okay everything we worked for is destroyed and now its gone.
Guess you didn't mean it when you said you needed me.

"Eu tirei minha carteira ontem
Como a gente sempre conversou
Cê tava animada por mim
Pra que eu pudesse passar pelo seu jardim
Mas hoje eu dirijo pelas ruas
Chorando a luz da lua 

E provavelmente tá com aquele cara
Que sempre me fez mal
Ele é mais velho que eu
E meu medo é que ele vá te fazer mal
Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelas ruas
Pensando em como te esquecer 

Eu sei que eu não era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode tá tão bem, com outro alguém
Acho que você não falou sério quando disse pra mim
Que era “pra sempre” e agora tudo chegou ao fim 

E os meus amigos não aguentam
Mais ouvir falar
E eu não os culpo porque
Eles nunca vão saber como foi te amar 

Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelas ruas
Pensando em ir até você 

Eu sei que eu não era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode tá tão bem, com outro alguém
Acho que você não falou sério quando disse pra mim
Que era “pra sempre” e agora tudo chegou ao fim 

Olhar, brilhar
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros, telhados
Não consigo parar de pensar no outono, eu questiono
Porque eu ainda te amo amor? 

Te abraçar, na praça
Eu ainda te escuto nas ruas, escuras
No meio do barulho
Isso é tão novo, imaturo 
Porque eu ainda te amo amor? (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh) 

Eu sei que eu não era perfeito
Mas eu nunca me senti desse jeito por ninguém 

E nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode estar tão bem, com outro alguém 

Acho que você não falou sério quando disse pra mim
Que era “pra sempre” e agora tudo chegou ao fim

Original Tradução

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street
All my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you
But I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you
The way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one, oh-oh
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to, go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we cross
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We're laughing over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way, for no one
And I just can't imagine
How you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever
Now I drive alone past your street

carteira de motorista
Recebi minha carteira de motorista semana passada
Como a gente sempre conversava
Porque você estava tão empolgado que eu
Finalmente fosse dirigir até sua casa
Mas hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
Chorando porque você não estava comigo
E você provavelmente está com aquela garota loira
A que sempre me fez duvidar
Ela é muito mais velha que eu
Ela é tudo aquilo que me deixa insegura
Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
Porque como eu poderia amar outra pessoa?
E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Todos os meus amigos estão cansados
De me ouvir falando o quanto eu sinto sua falta
Mas eu meio que sinto pena deles
Porque eles nunca vão te conhecer
Do jeito que eu te conheço, é
Hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
E me imaginei indo para casa encontrar você
E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém, oh-oh
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Luzes vermelhas, placas de Pare
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros brancos, jardins
Não consigo passar pelos lugares que costumávamos ir
Porque eu ainda te amo pra caralho, amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Calçadas que atravessamos
Eu ainda escuto sua voz no trânsito
Nós dois rindo por cima de todo aquele barulho
Deus, eu estou tão triste, sei que terminamos
Mas eu ainda te amo pra caralho, meu amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você poderia estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

licencia de conducir
Conseguí mi licencia de conducir la semana pasada
Como siempre hablábamos que lo haría
Porque estabas tan emocionado por mí
Para finalmente conducir hasta tu casa
Pero hoy conduje por los suburbios
Llorando, porque no estabas cerca

Y probablemente estás con esa chica rubia
La que siempre me hizo sospechar
Ella es mucho mayor que yo
Ella es todo lo que me hace insegura

Sí, hoy conduje por los suburbios
Porque ¿cómo yo podría amar a alguien más?

Y sé que no éramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido así por nadie
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
Cómo podrías estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo decías en serio en esa canción que escribiste sobre mí
Porque dijiste que lo nuestro era para siempre
Ahora conduzco sola por tu calle

Y todos mis amigos están hartos
De escucharme diciendo cuánto te extraño
Pero siento un poco de pena por ellos
Porque nunca te conocerán
Como te conozco, sí

Hoy conduje por los suburbios
Y me imaginé conduciendo a casa contigo

Y sé que no éramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido así por nadie, oh-oh
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
Cómo podrías estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo decías en serio en esa canción que escribiste sobre mí
Porque dijiste que lo nuestro era para siempre
Ahora conduzco sola por tu calle

Luces rojas, señal de stop
Todavía veo tu cara en carros blancos, jardines
No puedo pasar por los lugares que solíamos ir
Porque todavía te amo mucho, mi amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Veredas que cruzamos
Aún escucho tu voz en el tráfico, tú y yo riéndonos
Incluso con todo el ruido
Por Dios, estoy tan triste, sé que rompimos
Pero todavía te amo mucho, mi amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Sé que no éramos perfectos
Pero nunca me he sentido así por nadie
Y simplemente no puedo imaginar
Cómo podrías estar tan bien ahora que me he ido
Y creo que no lo decías en serio en esa canción que escribiste sobre mí

"drivers license Toxic Friendship Edition 
[Verse 1]
I haven’t got my driver’s license 
That’s what you always talked about
‘Cause you were so excited for me 
To finally drive us to the lake
But today I went to the theatre
Smiling 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
You're probably in your bedroom
And crying your eyes out
I know you think you’re guiltless 
I know why you think I’m the villain now
Yeah, today I went to the theatre
'Cause you hurt me but I won’t tell you how  

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy
But I've never felt this pain from no one
And I just can't believe that I’m not crying 
I’m okay now that you're gone
Guess I didn't mean what I wrote in that song for your birthday
‘Cause I thought you loved me, but you blew wind into the heat 

[Verse 3]
And all your friends are phony 
But they might be better for you, and 
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know that you like to lie too, yeah
Today I walked to the theatre 
And pictured I was in there without you 

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy 
But I've never felt this pain from no one, oh
And I just can't believe that I’m not crying 
I’m okay now that you're gone
I guess I didn't mean what I wrote in that song for your birthday
‘Cause I thought you loved me, but you’re never happy for me 

[Bridge]
Wide-eyed, long nights 
I still see your eyes in the dark now, tears now
Never understood you and your cold heart, bad art
'Cause I know that I hurt you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Fine lines you crossed
I still hear your voice in the call now, your dead now
Wish I never met you
‘Cause I hate you, glad we're through
'Cause you can’t stand to lose a fight (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
And I know you were happy
But I've never felt this pain from no one
And I just can't believe that I’m not crying 
I’m okay now that you're gone
‘Cause I hate that song that I shouldn’t have wrote for your birthday
‘Cause I thought you loved me, but you blew wind into the heat

"He told me you got your drivers license last week
you’re all he ever talks about
he was so excited for you 
told me when i got to his house 
said he watched you drive through the suburbs 
i cried a bit while he wasn’t around 

yea i turned out to be that blond girl
i know i made you dought
but your so much prettier than me
you have nothing to be insecure about 
he watched you drive through the suburbs
don’t know if he could ever love someone else

I wish we were perfect but he doesn’t feel the same about me
I just can’t get him to love me the same way now that your gone 
I know he sure meant what he wrote in that song about you
Cause I’ll love him forever but i don’t know how he feels about me 

All my friends are tired hearing all my worries about him
I kinda wish they would listen cause they’ll never understand how i love you
he watched you drive through the suburbs
i bet he wished he was out there driving with you

I wish we were perfect but he doesn’t feel the same about me
I just can’t get him to love me the same way now that your gone 
I know he sure meant what he wrote in that song about you
Cause I’ll love him forever but i don’t know how he feels about me 

Red flags stop signs i know i should leave him
cause he loves you can’t get in between his love for you
cause he still crazy loves you hey

Silence when i ask who he’s texting now
cause we’re not always laughing i’m over all the fights
yea i’m so blue he loves you
yea he still crazy loves you hey

I wish we were perfect but he doesn’t feel the same about me
I just can’t get him to love me the same way now that your gone

"J'ai eu mon permis de conduire la semaine dernière
Comme on en parlait toujours
Parce que tu avais si hâte
Qu'enfin je conduise jusqu'à chez toi
Mais aujourd'hui j'ai conduit à travers la banlieue
En pleurant car tu n'étais pas là
 
Et tu es probablement avec cette fille blonde
Qui m'a toujours fait douter
Elle est tellement plus âgée que moi
Elle représente tout ce que je ne suis pas 1
Oui, aujourd'hui j'ai conduit à travers la banlieue
Car comment pourrais-je un jour aimer quelqu'un d'autre ?
 
Et je sais qu'on n'était pas parfaits mais je n'ai jamais ressenti ça pour qui que ce soit d'autre
Et je ne peux même pas imaginer comment tu pourrais être bien maintenant que je ne suis plus là
Je suppose que tu ne pensais pas ce que tu as écrit dans cette chanson sur moi
Parce que tu disais ""pour toujours"", maintenant je conduis seule devant ta rue
 
Et tous mes amis en ont marre
D'entendre combien tu me manques, mais
Je me sens un peu mal pour eux
Parce qu'ils ne te connaîtront jamais comme moi, non
Aujourd'hui j'ai conduit à travers la banlieue
Et je m'imaginais conduire vers chez nous
 
Et je sais qu'on n'était pas parfaits mais je n'ai jamais ressenti ça pour qui que ce soit d'autre, non, non
Et je ne peux même pas imaginer comment tu pourrais être bien maintenant que je ne suis plus là
Je suppose que tu ne pensais pas ce que tu as écrit dans cette chanson sur moi
Parce que tu disais ""pour toujours"", maintenant je conduis seule devant ta rue
 
Des feux rouges, des panneaux stop,
Je vois encore ton visage dans les voitures blanches, les jardins
Je ne peux pas passer devant les endroits où on allait
Parce que putain je t'aime encore chéri (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Les trottoirs qu'on arpentait
J'entends encore ta voix dans les bouchons, on rit
Plus fort que tout le bruit
Mon Dieu, je suis si fleur bleue, je sais que c'est fini
Mais putain je t'aime encore chéri (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
 
Et je sais qu'on n'était pas parfaits mais je n'ai jamais ressenti ça pour qui que ce soit d'autre
Et je ne peux même pas imaginer comment tu pourrais être bien maintenant que je ne suis plus là
Je suppose que tu ne pensais pas ce que tu as écrit dans cette chanson sur moi

"Licencia de conducir en mano
Me ayudaste a pasar
Estabas tan emocionado
Por verme al fin hoy manejar
Pero me dirijo a los suburbios
Sin ti, duele más
Probablemente estés con
La chica ideal
Me vuelve insegura
La miro y mi confianza vuelve a fallar
Pero me dirijo hoy a los suburbios
Porque no puedo amarte más
No éramos perfectos por amar así a una persona
Nunca podré imaginar
Dime ¿por qué estás bien? ¡Dime ahora!
Supongo que no era verdad lo que hablabas de mí
Dijiste por siempre y te fuiste sin más que decir
Todos están cansados
De escucharme sufrir, pero
Lo siento tanto por ellos
Nadie dimensiona mi amor hacia ti
Me dirijo hoy a los suburbios
Te imaginé a mi lado al conducir
No éramos perfectos por amar así a una persona
Ooh, nunca podré imaginar
Dime ¿por qué estás bien? ¡Tú ahora!
Supongo que no era verdad lo que hablabas de mí
Dijiste por siempre y te fuiste sin más que decir

Yo te puedo ver
Entre autos blancos
Quisiera volver
Recordando ando
Voy porque aún te amo, babe
Sigues vivo
Puedo oír tu voz
En el ruido, reímos
Pero triste estoy
Terminamos llorando
Voy porque aún te amo, babe
No éramos perfectos por amar así a una persona

"I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do, yeah
Today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay, now that I'm gone

"Tradução:

Recebi minha carteira de motorista semana passada
Como a gente sempre conversava
Porque você estava tão empolgado que eu
Finalmente fosse dirigir até sua casa
Mas hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
Chorando porque você não estava comigo

E você provavelmente está com aquela garota loira
A que sempre me fez duvidar
Ela é muito mais velha que eu
Ela é tudo aquilo que me deixa insegura

Sim, hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
Porque como eu poderia amar outra pessoa?

E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

Todos os meus amigos estão cansados
De me ouvir falando o quanto eu sinto sua falta
Mas eu meio que sinto pena deles
Porque eles nunca vão te conhecer
Do jeito que eu te conheço, é

Hoje eu dirigi pelos subúrbios
E me imaginei indo para casa encontrar você

E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém, oh-oh
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você pode estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua

Luzes vermelhas, placas de Pare
Eu ainda vejo seu rosto em carros brancos, jardins
Não consigo passar pelos lugares que costumávamos ir
Porque eu ainda te amo pra caralho, amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Calçadas que atravessamos
Eu ainda escuto sua voz no trânsito
Nós dois rindo por cima de todo aquele barulho
Deus, eu estou tão triste, sei que terminamos
Mas eu ainda te amo pra caralho, meu amor (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

E eu sei que não éramos perfeitos
Mas nunca me senti assim por ninguém
E eu nem consigo imaginar
Como você poderia estar tão bem, agora que eu fui embora?
Acho que você não estava falando sério naquela música que escreveu sobre mim
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua
Porque você disse que seria para sempre
Agora eu dirijo sozinha pela sua rua",0.9188,Positive,0.1131076388888889,Neutral,-0.3458699584007263,Negative

"I heard u got ur license last week
Just like u always talked about And yeah I’m so excited fot u to finally drive yourself around
But today I drove off to college 
And that’s why I’m not around 


And yeah I’m with that blonde girl, the one u worried about 
She’s the same age as me and in the same phase I’m in now

Yeah today I drove off to college cause don’t we all just become someone else

And I know that ur hurting cause u never felt this way for no one

And it’s hard to imagine but I know you’ll be ok now that I’m gone

I heard everything in ur song that blew up about me
But nothing is forever especially when ur seventeen 

If all ur friends are tired then tell them I don’t miss u 
I don’t feel sorry for them cause they’ll never know what u put me through 

Yeah today I drove off to college and I left behind all the pictures I had of you",-0.3686,Negative,-0.0551282051282051,Negative,-0.2768507897853851,Negative
