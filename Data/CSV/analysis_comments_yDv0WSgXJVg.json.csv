"Quien eres tu? (Who are you?)

Donde has estado? (where have you been?)

He removido cielo y tierra y no te encontre

(I moved heaven and earth and not find you)


Y llegas hoy (but you arrive today)

Tan de repente (So suddenly)

Y das sentido a toda mi vida con tu querer

(and give meaning to my life with your love)


Na main samjha, na main jaana

Jo bhi tumne mujhse kahaa hai Senorita

Magar phir bhi, na jaane kyun

Mujhe sunke, accha laga hai senorita


No desvies la mirada (do not look away)

Quedate cerca de mi (stay close to me)


Mujhko baahon mein tum ghero

Samjhi na senorita


Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye

Duniya mein yeh bhi kam hai kya

Do pal ko toh aao kho jaaye

Bhoole hum hota gham hai kya senorita

Suno suno senorita kehte hain hum kya


Jamas podre (i will never)

Interpretar (understand)

El sentido de las palabras que me dedicas

(the meaning of the words you dedicate to me)


Pero el calor (but the warmth)

De tu mirar (of your gaze)

Me hace sentir como la mas bella senorita

(Makes me like the most beautiful miss)


Nighaahon ne nighaahon se

Kahi armaano ki daastan hai senorita

Yeh chaahat ki, mohabbat ki

Saari duniya mein ek hi zubaan hai senorita


Mujhse ab nazar na phero, aao paas tum mere


Mujhko baahon mein tum ghero

Samjhi na Senorita


Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye

Duniya mein yeh bhi kum hai kya

Do pal ko toh aao kho jaaye

Bhoole hum hota gumm hai kya senorita

Suno suno senorita kehte hain hum kya


Jo bhi pal beeta

Hey senorita

Har pal tumne hai dil jeeta

Bus itni si toh baat hai


No desvies la mirada (don't look away)

Quedate cerca de mi (stay close to me)


Mujhko baahon mein tum ghero

Samjhi na senorita


Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye

Duniya mein yeh bhi kum hai kya

Do pal ko toh aao kho jaaye

Bhoole hum hota gham hai kya

Chaahat ke do pal bhi, mil paaye

Duniya mein yeh bhi kum hai kya
