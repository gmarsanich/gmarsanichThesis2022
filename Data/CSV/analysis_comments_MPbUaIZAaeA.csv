"Jesus Christ Saves

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is returning very soon, and is the reason for all of the things that are happening on the Earth right now. This planet is on borrowed time.

Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried in a tomb, and rose from the dead 3 days later, to pay for the sins of mankind, to give us eternal life and forgiveness from God.

EXACTLY how to be Saved by Jesus Christ, the Son of God:

1. Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord.

2. Believe in your heart that God has raised Jesus Christ from the dead.

Biblical References:

2. Romans 3:23

Their voices are good and so is this collaboration. Everybody's talking about it but what's important is what this song's about. Are celebrities not allowed to be depressed and get angry. Are they not allowed to be anxious sometimes and maybe lash out like human beings. we get too harsh on them if they show even a little human side of theirs. It's seriously a privilege for us that we can act out our emotions and people won't remember it. They don't have that privilege.

"Well apparently I've been living under a rock out in nowheres-ville cuz I had no idea who this kid Mendez even was..oops my bad but for my defence I don't listen to the radio and pretty much just listen to my own playlist...my point is, I fricken LOVE this!! These two are great together!!! Post Malone is my go to dude that I listen to a lot, not only cuz his music  is fricking awesome but cuz he's an all around good dude with swarm & loving heart and he stays positive about everything!!That being said, I actually do listen to Bieber a lot too . I never thought I'd like what he did years ago...man was I a dumb dumb. I've missed a lot of good music through the years. Believe it or not I'm 54 and I'm into a lot of R&B, pop, some rap I like even...I'm open to anything ...just music that makes u FEEL GOOD... the tunes that raise your vibration!  Sorry I rambled on and on but yeah these two dudes are pretty awesome too! Got Mad love and respect for them! 💜✌️",0.9973,Positive,0.2731966403162055,Neutral,0.5935969352722168,Positive
