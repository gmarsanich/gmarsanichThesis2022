 Forward this ⬇️ video to your friends 🤝, and ask them forward it to theirs.

 This is highly important that political leaders close the sky above Ukraine 🦅 

 Help us get rid of Russian fighters, bombers and missiles. Just give us jets and anti-missile systems. The rest we do ourselves.

 The West must stop silently watching how Ukraine is being destroyed and Ukrainians are being killed.  Supplying weapons and humanitarian aid is not enough to stop the aggression of the second largest (not second strongest) army in the world 🇷🇺
