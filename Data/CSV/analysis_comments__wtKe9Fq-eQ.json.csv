"Them talking to the body reminds me of a youtube channel that does professional cleaning and in one of the videos they're cleaning and decontaminating an apartment where a man was discovered very dead and decayed. In the beginning of the video he explains what happened when he came to inspect the place before cleaning and found the body, he called the police to inform them and they were like ""ok but can you try poking it or calling out to it just to make sure tho"". The body was black from decay, leaking all sorts of things and stiff in rigor mortis. It was just a check list thing to make absolutely sure, i know that, but I found it very funny.",0.625,Positive,0.1605059523809524,Netural,0.39899304509162903,Positive

"I like how it organically assumed a form of a horror movie trope: a merry company that's having a good time, then they hear gunshots and suddenly no one is laughing anymore. Then the discovery of a corpse. A few more jokes after that, but the general tone is already additionally blackened by Mark's intentive listening of the woods, expecting trouble nearby.
This accidental scenario just makes me happy. It makes me happy that a videogame helped to produce something like that.",0.9144,Positive,0.30625,Netural,0.6554813385009766,Positive
