"Hello Gibi, I have been watching your videos since about 2020. You are one of the only asmrtists that can actually relax me and help me sleep. I have trouble sleeping but I’m not going to say that I have insomnia because that would be self diagnosing, but I have a lot of trouble sleeping. I’m so glad that I found you when I did because you bring my stress level down so much and you help me sleep almost every night. I’m so great full for all the work you put into making these videos. Thank you so much Gibi for being one of the best asmrtists I’ve ever watched. Hope everyone has a wonderful rest of their day/afternoon/night <3.

Hi Gibi! I’m glad you’re being very transparent about the the Gfuel NFTs. I personally don’t like or support them. But one of my coworkers came up to me at work the other day and we both are very into art. She was telling me of a new app she was into(trying to get me also into) and she started talking about making NFTs and that I should do it. I felt soooo uncomfortable I didn’t know what to say and I didn’t want to be rude. But I’d rather not have my art get stolen lol. Also the breath in and out part was so good!

Thank you Gibi for a very relaxing video! I still remember when I needed lazy eye surgery when I was a teenager I went to a doctor/Surgeon who did my surgery then after was my doctor for years. I liked her because she was nice she drove a cool Corvette and was a Yankees fan like me. I was told before I was 18 that I was too old to see a pediatrician I cried and sobbed so much I still get teary eyed thinking of having to say goodbye to her.
