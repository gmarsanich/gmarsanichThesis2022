"1:12 ""Go away, do not come near me, I won't comeback no matter what you say."" - Seo Soo-jin, 14th August 2018 in the music video HANN.

And if we look at a week ago, it was 14th August 2021, the 3rd year aniversary of HANN, but Cube decided to throw a bombshell and kicked Soojin out at that very day. Even after a whole week, we Neverlands are still looking for answers. And this line of Soojin makes me cry badly. I know we all want Soojin to come back and so do I. But i honestly thing that our 6 yes (SIX) queens

"Too much, CUBE is so selfish that it takes the kids out of the band....😡(Fucking labels don't give a reason why they leave the group) There must be a few more groups that artists have to withdraw Oh my god 🔥 E-CUBE should close the Agency, shouldn't create an idol group and find a way out, can't be selfish of yourself as a Agency site. Have you ever kept anyone?
Since the CLC? Essy ""SooJin"", any Agency has been accepted to join T. Soojin  is a beautiful diamond. Let's meet only good things. Idle should not go to collect E-cube. From the trash,Soojin goes Solo, keep supporting her, our main T_T
Thank you so much #Soojin(G)I-DLE ❤️
Sigh. Ghost Agency. No matter how ghosts are, day and night, yesterday's still cursing the story. CLC, but today Cube has announced that Sujin will be leaving (G)I-dle and the group will continue their activities as 5 members.
*The thing that upsets me is that this Agency has never been clear about anything. Let everything be vague and then let the kid leave the band like this because he's afraid the band can't go on? But take the kid away. Does that mean that children have to be branded as well? Do good camps do this? No! It's a Agency for self-interest
*Or if SooJin is really wrong, he should come out and make a statement to make it clear for the victim to clarify what justice has been given to let the child rest for a while and wait to come back, whatever. But this is not a pretty solution at all. Confused, all really sucks. CUBE",-0.6433,Negative,-0.0030797101449275472,Negative,-0.7555094957351685,Negative

"그대여, 왜 그렇게 쳐다보나요?
아무 말도 건네주지 않고
나의 눈을 피하지도 않고 oh

그대여, 왜 그렇게 가까이 와요?
아직 우린 모르는 게 많죠
나 그댈 뭐라 불러야 하죠?

조금 빠르게, 어쩜 바쁘게
뭐든 I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
뭔가 다르게, 더 나쁘게
뭐든 I'm ok, I'm ok, I'm ok

다가와 줘요 내게로, 안아줘 세게 더
알고 싶어 about you-u-u-u-u
I fell in love with you, 몰라요 it is true
그냥 love you so, love you so
Love you so 불러줘요 나를

Senorita
Senorita
Senorita
Senorita

그대여, 왜 그렇게 웃고 있나요?
자꾸 마음이 그대에게 가죠
나 그댈 어찌 보내야 하죠?

그냥 넌 나에게만 집중해봐
남들 눈이 중요한가?
가득 품에 안아줘 봐
이름 따위 몰라도 돼
갖고 싶다 말해 봐봐 사랑해봐

워어어워어어 (um'mm)
워어어워어어 (um'mm)
워어어워어어 (hey senor)

다가와 줘요 내게로, 안아줘 세게 더

Love you so 불러줘요 나를
