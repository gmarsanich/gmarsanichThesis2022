"The Gospel
¨For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.¨
John 3:16
¨For i delivered to you first of all that which i also received: how Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, was buried, rose again the third day according to the scriptures,¨ 
1 Corinthians 15:3-4
¨Jesus answered, ¨Truly, truly I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.¨ 
John 3:5
¨that if you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God has raised from the dead, you will be saved,¨
Romans 10:9
The story: God loved the world(us) so much that He gave His one and only Son to die in our place. If you ever feel like you're not loved, remember the creator of the universe sent His Son to die in your place regardless if you believe in him or not!
¨Why did Jesus have to die?¨
Because all of God's creation has rebelled against Him at some point, Yes! Even You and I. When God created everything in existence, He looked at it and said ¨It is Good.¨ Well I think we can all agree humanity as a whole is not good! We were made in the image of God yet as whole we are not good. We kill, steal, lie, commit crimes, ignore the needy, don´t obey our parents, we break the laws, and humanity as a whole has done every sort of evil under the sun.
¨Well I'm a good person!¨ To who´s standard? You have done at least one thing on the list above. Can you comfortably say lying is a trait of being a good person? What about stealing? You can say that but that would make you a liar and that would only prove my point. God creates the standard of good not us! His standard of good is perfect and none of us are perfect. Don´t let the arrogant ¨Christians¨ in church fool you either. They also are not perfect and need Jesus just as much as You and I.
¨So wait, why did Jesus have to die?¨ The answer is sin. We have all sinned and fell short of the glory of God. According to word, all of us will die someday and we will have to be face to face with God and give an account of everything we have ever done in our lives, good or bad. Your next question may be ¨does God know everything we have ever done?¨ The answer is yes, He is all knowing and Has a book of everything little thing you have ever done in your life and you will be judged off what you have done. Imagine this, you have to go to court to prove your innocence. You´re on trial and God is the judge. God will call your name and go through your book. He is going to ask why have you gone against him with the way you live and then ask if you think you really deserve to go to heaven. At this point any person would be terrified and speechless. How can we tell a perfect, Holy and all knowing God we deserve to go to heaven? We can´t! The bible says the wages of sin is death! In other words, one sin is enough to say you don't deserve to go to heaven. Wages means ¨something we have earned¨ when you work, your wages are a paycheck. When you sin, your wages are death. But the good news is if we place our trust in Jesus He acts as our lawyer. The Bible says he has the ability to blot out our sins! He can go in our book and remove anything that would keep us from going to heaven. How does that work exactly? Again the Bible says the wages of sin is death! Meaning for every sin something or someone has to die. Jesus came and died on the cross in our place. He took the punishment for us! He basically went into court and paid our fines so the judge could legally let us go. Jesus paid a price we could never afford. 
So Where is Jesus now? He is in heaven! God is a just and good father. He would never send his child to hell. Want to hear the greatest news in the history of the world? ¨But to all who believed in him and accepted him, He gave the right to become children of God. They are reborn-not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.¨ John 1:12-13
You can become a child of God! How do you do that? You have to believe in Jesus and His good news!
What is the good news? The Gospel literally means the good news. This is the gospel: ¨I passed on to you what was most important and what had also passed on to me. 1.) Christ died for our sins, just as the scriptures said. 2.) He was buried, and 3.) He was raised on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.¨ 1 Corinthians 15:3-4
¨Based on this how can I go to heaven?¨

¨If you <openly declare> that Jesus is Lord and 2.) believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved For it is believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, ¨Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced.¨ Romans 10:9-11



Jesus calls all men everywhere to repent(forsake sin). 
     Although God overlooked the periods of ignorance, now He commands everyone everywhere to repent. Acts 17:30. 
But if the wicked turns from all his sins that he has committed, and keeps all My laws and does what is lawful and right, he will surely live, he will not die. Ezekiel 18:21
It's not just a confession of sins but a change of action. Without repentance we will not inherit the kingdom of God.
Peter said to them, “Repent, and let each of you be immersed in the name of Messiah Yeshua for the removal of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Ruach ha-Kodesh. Acts 2:38

     One who covers up his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses and forsakes them finds mercy. Proverbs 28:13. 
Following Jesus isn't just a one time thing or a prayer; it's a relationship with him until the very end. 
     But the one who endures to the end will be saved. Matthew 24:13. 
If you are reading this all of this he is calling you to repentance he doesn't want you or anyone to perish but that all may be saved choose today whom you will serve. 
      For He says, “At a favorable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the favorable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation. 2 Corinthians 6:2

To those who truly repent(turn from sins) and believe in Jesus/Yeshua you will be gifted the holy spirit which will give you the power to obey and God's laws will be written on your heart.
      “This is the covenant that I will cut with them: ‘After those days,’ says Adonai , ‘I will put My Torah upon their hearts, and upon their minds I will write it,’” then He says,“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” Now where there is removal of these, there is no longer an offering for sin. Hebrews 10:16‭-‬18 

Whatever we have done it can be forgiven only through the blood of messiah
     for this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the removal of sins.
Matthew 26:28 
God also gives us power over sin to not just to forgive us and save us.
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, training us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live in a manner that is self-controlled and righteous and godly in the present age. Titus 2:11‭-‬12
