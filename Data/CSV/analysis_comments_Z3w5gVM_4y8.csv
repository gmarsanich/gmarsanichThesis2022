"@QueenHouse85 Why fuck communism? Communism is good, actually. There have been some shitty regimes that called themselves communist, but they've been dictatorships, not classless, cashless societies. Communism is a good idea. It's just been implemented in a very absolutist, brutal way in most places. What about Cuba? They're hangin' in there doing pretty well, have universal healthcare, have one of the lowest COVID death rates and infection rates in the world, and provide mutual aid for their most vulnerable citizens. I mean yea, it's not perfect, but neither is the US or Germany or any of these liberal democracies that claim that capitalism is the end all be all but are failing to take care of their most vulnerable citizens or prevent the spread of a preventable infection. Just seems like maybe your take on Communism is a bit overblown.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you grew up in a Communist regime that was brutal and oppressive like early post-war Vietnam or China or Romania or something. Or you're the child of someone who did. How far off the money am I?",-0.9699,Negative,-0.0229166666666666,Negative,0.3464233577251434,Positive

"Molte persone "" potenti"" o borghesi, amano creare intorno a sè ,teatrini di sfruttamento di questo genere. In poche parole,non si elevano per i propri meriti ma ,schiacciando definitivamente la dignità altrui,per piegarla a proprio volere anche con cifre irrisorie ,per rinforzare nel sottomesso,al proprio servizio ,la nullità * tu non vali niente ,puoi fare solo quello che ti meriti la mia il mio schiavo / a personale. Sei nato per questo è il tuo destino sii fortunato di essere in una casa signorile,è un privilegio,lavorare per me. Orbene ,anch' io per anni ,l' ho fatto per rimettermi in gioco lavorando mezza,giornata, in famiglie ,anziani soli,coppie ,e single,rispettosi nei miei confronti.Doppia chiave,caffè  frutta o biscottini a disposizione , fiducia per i propri oggetti personali. Potevo così tornare a casa ,in un orario decente ,per essere presente. In altro ruolo. Chi non ha una figura familiare fi sostegno( nonni,genitori) può far così quando i figli sono piccoli,e spesso dalle scuole ,asili,chiamano,per piccoli malesseri dei figli.  O semplicemente ,per accompagnare e riprendere i bimbi ,al bus scuola. Ci si accontenta ,sè di più ,in quel momento non si può fare e ti compri l' abitino o regalo da fare,che vuoi 🙋",0.9862,Positive,0.1267241379310345,Neutral,-0.4077393412590027,Negative

음악은 추억이 아닐까요
누군가에 신청곡으로 첨 듣는 음악을 듣게 되고
어디선가 그음악을 또 듣게 되면
아! 골방에서 들었던 그노래

이런 추억을 다른이에게도 만들어주셨내요

누군가 듣고싶어 신청해주신 이노래를
만들어주신 작사,작곡, 편곡자분들과 불러주신 가수분에게 
정말 감사합니다.


제댓글이 많아 불편하셨다면 정말 죄송합니다.

하지만 제 댓글이 많다는건
이노래를 신청해주신 분들이 많다는거에요

그시간에 신청해주신 분이 이댓글을 보신다면
행복해 하실꺼라는걸 알거든요

그래서 신청곡이 들어올때마다 댓글을 남겨드리고 있어요

"Comment what you want. If you have something that you really want in your life, spend lots of time thinking about it. The more you think the more ideas will pop up the more creative your gonna start to get. Your subconscious mind doesn't care if your vision is crazy. It doesnt care if you dont know how to do it. 
When you see a thing clearly in your mind, your creative ""success mechanism"" within you takes over and does the job much better than you could do it by conscious effort or willpower.
A different psychedelic from a different planet every nanosecond. 
All sorts of dreams are possible. 
The human nervous system cannot tell the difference between an ""actual"" experience and an experience imagined vividly and in detail. 
Synthesize ""experience,"" to literally create experience, and control it, in the laboratory of our minds. 
A vision is a very emotional image, the most powerful image that you can come up with for yourself at this time. This vision will become like a hallucination in other peoples mind and this could be the cause of them creating extraordinary things.",0.9758,Positive,0.1840579710144927,Neutral,0.2570604979991913,Neutral
