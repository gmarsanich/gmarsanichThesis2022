Also the change in the final refrain where everyone's verses are over-lapping and Isabela and Dolores' changes at 3:15 to them just repeating ""I'm Fine, I'm Fine"" is so sad to me.

"One thing that came up into my head is Pepa's wedding. We know her mood changes the weather so I wonder if it was actually going to be a storm if Bruno hadn't told Pepa about the future. According to the song, Felix says ""why did he tell her?"" and after that she instantly expresses how nervous she got. Was that some kind of future paradox? If he had never told Pepa about the weather, there wouldn't have been any storm in the first place but because he saw the storm, he had to tell her?

It kinda reminds me of That's So Raven when everything she does to stop her visions from happening was actually what caused the vision to happen in the first place.",0.212,Positive,0.1375,Netural,0.4157838225364685,Positive

"What if you didn’t understand what he saw?
 Then you better to figure it out,
because it was coming for you!
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
Rats along his back (we were getting ready)
When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)
Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)
And feasts on your screams (thunder!)
You telling this story, or am I?

"We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
Rats along his back (we were getting ready)
When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)
Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)
And feasts on your screams (thunder!)
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano's on his way)
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain"" (a seven-foot frame, rats along his back)
In doing so, he floods my brain
Married in a hurricane
He's here!
Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)

"imagine if every madrigal were playing hide and seek
assuming mirabel was the seeker, this is how i think it would play out
luisa would use her abilities to create barricades, forcing mirabel to take more time in getting to her
isabela would use her abilities to hide in some flowers, or maybe blind mirabel
camilo would definitely turn into a random object, like a desk or one of the roof shingles
dolores would always know where mirabel was, so for her she'll really just be trying to hide from mirabel
pepa would probably just lose instantly, she doesnt have much going for her and if she starts freaking out, the weather will reveal her
antonio would have some rats feeding him the location of the seeker, basically dolores except he doesnt have to go ""wait is that camilo or mirabel?""
bruno wouldn't even be able to use his gift, it'd reveal him

alternate scenarios for different seekers
luisa: not much going for her
isabela: use her powers to block off exits if she thinks someone is in a room
camilo: pretend to be another hider
dolores: instantly wins, she already knows where everyone is
pepa: cause small and controlled tornadoes or disasters to scare everyone into revealing themselves
antonio: will win as long as his animals can find the hiders
bruno: use the environment in his visions to pinpoint people (even though i dont think he controls what he sees)

characters without gifts werent included, they'll just be playing normal hide and seek",0.5423,Positive,0.078125,Netural,0.33001941442489624,Positive

We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""
Why did he tell us?

Abuela, get the umbrellas

What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!

"We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
Rats along his back (we were getting ready)
When he calls your name (and there wasn't a cloud in the sky)
It all fades to black (no clouds allowed in the sky!)
Yeah, he sees your dreams (Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-)
And feasts on your screams (thunder!)
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on (óye, Mariano's on his way)
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain"" (a seven-foot frame, rats along his back)
In doing so, he floods my brain
Married in a hurricane
He's here!
Don't talk about Bruno, no! (Why did I talk about Bruno?)
Not a word about Bruno!

"in spanish No se habla de Bruno, no, no, no

No se habla de Bruno

Mas

Justo en mi boda fue (en nuestra boda fue)

Todo estaba listo con un clima precioso esa vez (ninguna nube esa vez)

Bruno con voz misteriosa habló (¡trueno!)

¿Tú cuentas la historia o lo hago yo? (Lo siento, mi vida, hazlo tú)

Veo que pronto lloverá (¿qué insinuaba?)

Sabrás que lo tomé muy mal (abuela, ten la sombrilla)

Boda en un huracán (fue un día feliz, pero es verdad)

No se habla de Bruno, no, no, no

No se habla de Bruno (hey)

Miedo al ver a Bruno balbuceando y tropezando

Siempre lo recuerdo murmurando y farfullando

Su sonido es como la arena al resbalar

Raro el don de ir visualizando

Deja a la abuela, como a todos, temblando

Enfrentando profecías sin interpretar

¿Quieres tú intentar?

Terror en su faz, ratas por detrás

Al oír tu nombre no hay marcha atrás

Grita mientras tiembles al despertar (hey)

No se habla de Bruno, no, no, no (no se habla de Bruno)

No se habla de Bruno (no se habla de Bruno)

Él dijo: ""mi pez se moriría"", ¡y ve! (no, no)

Él dijo: ""serás panzón"", y justo así fue (no, no)

Él dijo que me quedaría sin pelo y mírame bien (no, no)

Las profecías se cumplen cada vez

Él vio en mí un destino gentil

Una vida de ensueños vendrá

Y que así el poder de mi don

Como uvas va a madurar

Oye, Mariano va a llegar

Él vio en mí un amor imposible

Pactado, al fin, en lazos con otra

Casi lo puedo oír (hey, tú)

De ti ni un sonido saldrá (cual si lo pudiera oír)

Yo lo puedo oír

Oh, Bruno, sí, sobre Bruno

Ya digan lo que sepan de Bruno

Denme la pura verdad de Bruno

Isabela, tu amor llegó (a la mesa)

Justo en mi boda fue (en nuestra boda fue)

Todo estaba listo con un clima precioso esa vez (ninguna nube esa vez)

Bruno con voz misteriosa habló (¡trueno!)

¿Tú cuentas la historia o lo hago yo? (lo siento, mi vida, hazlo tú)

Veo que pronto lloverá (¿qué insinuaba?)

Sabrás que lo tomé muy mal (abuela, ten la sombrilla)

Boda en un huracán (fue un día feliz, pero es verdad)

Llegaron (no hablemos de Bruno)

¿Por qué hablé sobre Bruno? (no hay que hablar sobre Bruno)

"We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno... but
It was my wedding day
It was our wedding day
We were getting ready, and there wasn't a cloud in the sky
No clouds allowed in the sky
Bruno walks in with a mischievous grin-
Thunder!
You telling this story, or am I?
I'm sorry, mi vida, go on
Bruno says, ""It looks like rain""
Why did he tell us?
In doing so, he floods my brain
Abuela, get the umbrellas
Married in a hurricane
What a joyous day... but anyway
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!
We don't talk about Bruno!
Hey! Grew to live in fear of Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I could always hear him sort of muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the sound of falling sand, ch-ch-ch
It's a heavy lift, with a gift so humbling
Always left Abuela and the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies they couldn't understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame
Rats along his back
When he calls your name
It all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
And feasts on your screams (hey!)
We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no! (We don't talk about Bruno, no, no, no!)
We don't talk about Bruno (we don't talk about Bruno!)
He told me my fish would die
The next day: dead! (No, no!)
He told me I'd grow a gut!
And just like he said... (no, no!)
He said that all my hair would disappear, now look at my head (no, no! Hey!)
Your fate is sealed when your prophecy is read!
He told me that the life of my dreams would be promised, and someday be mine
He told me that my power would grow, like the grapes that thrive on the vine
Óye, Mariano's on his way
He told me that the man of my dreams would be just out of reach
Betrothed to another
It's like I hear him now
Hey sis', I want not a sound out of you (it's like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno...
Yeah, about that Bruno...
I really need to know about Bruno...
Gimmie the truth and the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabella, your boyfriend's here)
Time for dinner!
A seven-foot frame (it was my wedding day, it was our wedding day)
