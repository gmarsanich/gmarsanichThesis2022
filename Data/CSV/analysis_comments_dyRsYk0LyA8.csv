I’ve been a fan since 2NE1, YG lifetime lasting hiatuses still never fail to disappoint me. 
Maybe the next news we will get about BP will be the disbanding. 
That’s exactly what happened with 2NE1, they were back recording a new album after a 3 years hiatus and everything was canceled to disband them. 
YG won’t change their ways…

I bet they will come back with a single including only one song and they’ll have another 12 months hiatus after that.",0.7512,Positive,0.0627705627705627,Positive,-0.3436241745948791,Negative
