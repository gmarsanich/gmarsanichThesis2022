"I feel like sex(I'm not saying gender because gender is identity and identity is something that a person discovers way later on, it's different from your physical sex. Least on a scientific scale, and an Alphabet Mafia scale.) reveal parties for unborn babies should for one be private and not recorded as an internet video-but two NOT shared with small children because they may oppose it which bums people out and I'm sure lots of parents can agree with the idea of wanting to ease their household into the idea of another family member coming into the household. I dunno, if yall wanna have a fricken party for the sex of your baby thats your choice but also at the same time you should-as recommendation-not inviting kids or recording it and then posting it online because it's rather moronic to try and gain followers based on ""wholesome"" moments.

"I'm Russian! What does it mean to be Russian today? Being Russian means that the whole world will consider you a second-rate person. Racism is rampant! Hypocritical white Americans oppressed African Americans for 400 years, did not consider them human, tortured and held in slavery. Just because they have a different skin color. Also today the whole world oppresses and hates Russians . What is the difference between hatred of Russians and hatred of African Americans? The answer is simple - nothing! This is racism and Russians have been putting up with it for many years. It started long before the special operation in Ukraine. The whole world hypocritically watched Russians being killed in the Donbas. The whole world has seen how Russian children, old men and women die. The whole world saw how crowds of Ukrainian fascists shouted Racist slogans soaked in hatred of everything Russian in the squares. And when the Russians started defending their rights, defending their nation and people, killing Ukrainian racists. The whole world has shown its true face. The face of racism, hatred and cruelty. The sanctions of Europe and America against Russia are the ""Racist Whip"" that is in the hands of hypocritical Nazis!!!!",-0.9971,Negative,0.104130626860119,Neutral,-0.6871771216392517,Negative
