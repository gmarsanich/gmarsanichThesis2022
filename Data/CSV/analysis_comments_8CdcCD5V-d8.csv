"Lyrics:
I got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you
Scream ""Piss off, screw you""
When it talks to you
Like you don't belong
Or tell you
You're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you like

Knock, knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been
Head is spinnin' this medicine's
Screaming L-L-L-Let us in
L-L-Like a salad bowl
Edgar Allen Poe bed ridden
Should have been dead a long time ago
Liquid tylenol
Gelatins
Think my skeletons meltin'
Wicked I get all high
When I think I smell the scent of elephant
Manure hell
I meant kahlua
Screw it
To hell with it I went through hell with accelerant's
And blew up My-My-Myself again
Volks-Waggin'
Tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellman's
And bein' rail in Filet-O-Fish
Scribble Jam Rap Olympics
'97 Freaknik
How can I be down me and?
Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room
Slept on the floor of 'da
Motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell Yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard
Word to melman
And I know there gonna hate
But I don't care
I barely can wait ta hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face
This fuckin' world better prepare
To get laced because there gonna taste my

Venom
I got that adrenaline, momentum, and I'm
Not knowing when I'm
Ever, gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
W-W-When they get bit with the
Venom
I got that adrenaline, momentum, and I'm
Not knowing when I'm
Ever, gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
W-W-When they get bit with the

I said
Knock, knock, let the devil in
Shot gun
P-P-Pellets in the felt pen
Cocked fuck around and catch a hot one
It It's evident I'm not done
V-V-Venomous the thoughts spun like a web and
You're just caught in 'em
Held against your will
Like a hubcap
Or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills
Fuck up the track
Like
What's her names at the wheel Danika Patrick
Threw the car into reverse
At the indie a nut crashin'
In ta ya the back of it just magled
Steel my mustang
And the Jeep wrangler grill
With the front smashed
Much as my rear fender assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual Kamikaze and Gandhi
Translation I will
Probably kill us both when I end up backin' (India)
You ain't gonna be able to tell
What the fucks happen
In to ya
When you're bit with the

Venom
I got that adrenaline, momentum, and I'm
Not knowing when I'm
Ever, gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
W-W-When they get bit with the
Venom
I got that adrenaline, momentum, and I'm
Not knowing when I'm
Ever, gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
W-W-When they get bit with the

I said
Knock, knock, let the devil in
Alien
E-E-Eliot phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end
I'm loco
Became a symbiote
My fangs are in your  throat hoe
You're snake bitten with my
Venom
With the ball point pen I'm
Gun cocked
Bump stock
Double ought
Buck shot
Tire thumper
A garrotte
Tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught
Fire juggernaut
Punk rock
Bitch It's goin' down like young joc cause the doc
Put me on like sun block
But I fuck not
You only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it 
Chased it with straight  liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me-

Venom

"Love it ! 😂 mum and dad WERE loosing their marbles, 
You WERE the music that he would listen to 
But no you weren’t the reason my life was ‘ruined’ 
Actually you helped my dad cope, the same for me. He had a shockingly similar life with his mother and home life, unfortunately dad didn’t have it in him to overcome his troubles and past away in 2017 of alcoholism and drug abuse 
But you do inspire me to turn my family roots around and be better for my children. 

My dad stopped the cycle of abuse and I am forever proud of him for that because the abuse he and his siblings endured is unbearable to think about.  

Now I have stopped the cycle of drug and alcohol abuse. 

So Marshall please never ever stop doing what you’re doing you have no idea how many lives you inspire and motivate to change.

"I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like-
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', ""L-L-L-Let us in!""
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure, hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my-
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the-)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the-)
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the-
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm

(W-W-When they get bit with the-)
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, hoe
You're snake-bitten with my, venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
