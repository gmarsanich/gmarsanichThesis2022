First time I realized he wasn't singing.  Which is staggering considering what Nuclear explosion this five minutes performance was. Before this day he was just a guy who went solo from the Jackson 5. The day after this he became the most famous person since Jesus Christ. And that is not an exaggeration. Think of the most famous person today or the last 20 years. They were not  even 5% as famous as MJ in the 80s,0.0,Neutral,0.3928571428571428,Positive,-0.3349335491657257,Negative

I remember sitting with my family watching this at the age of 4.  I knew I was watching a genius at work. In my mind I just thought I would never ever witness a moment like this ever again. I was in complete awe of him and I still am to this day. However I have come to the realisation that this performance touched millions of people around the world to be inspired. Just to add nobody really talks about 3:34 -3:39 which is the dance routine just before the moonwalk. That segment of dance is just brilliant because it makes the moonwalk look so effortless.,0.8591,Positive,0.4000000000000001,Positive,0.5791592597961426,Positive

Eye witness testimonies shared in the comments about the impact of this performance on the mainstream conscious are not exaggerated.   

The following day, everybody was talking about Michael Jackson.  Everyone!  Teachers, friends, family, the news... His music was already #1 on the radio, but we'd never seen him dance.  It blew our minds. 

Many years later when he passed, I was older,  not really a huge MJ fan.

"She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, « Don’t mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round? »
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, « Be careful of what you do.
And don’t go around breaking young girls’ hearts. »
And mother always told me, « A-be careful of who you love,
And be careful of what you do
‘Cause the lie becomes the truth. »
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand
When she’s in demand
Her schemes and plans
‘Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice.)
She told, « My baby, we’d danced ’til three. »
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cry
His eyes looked like mine, oh, no
Do a dance on the floor in the round, baby
A-people always told me, « Be careful of what you do
And don’t go around breaking young girls’ hearts. »
(Don’t break no heart.)
A-but she came and stood right by me
And just the smell of sweet perfume
And this happened much too soon
And she called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No, no, no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She’s just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, there’s not me, baby.)
But the kid is not my son
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no.)
She says I am the one (No, babe.)
But the kid is not my son, no, no, no
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
Don’t call me Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is the one
She stumbled onto the scene
Billie Jean is not my lover

He started practicing moonwalk by watching YouTube videos. He practices dancing like Michael since this discovery early this 2022. The other day he told everyone at home to address him as Mr. Jackson.
