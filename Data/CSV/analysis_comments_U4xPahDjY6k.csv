Yeah, I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road
I’m gonna ride ’til I can’t no more
I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road
I’m gonna ride ’til I can’t no more

Verse 1

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that’s black to match

Ridin’ on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain’t been up off that porch, now

Transition

Can’t nobody tell me nothin’
You can’t tell me nothin’
Can’t nobody tell me nothin’
You can’t tell me nothin’

Verse 2

Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin’ and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

Verse 3

Hat down, cross town, livin’ like a rock star
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby’s got a habit:
Diamond rings and Fendi sports bras

Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I’ve been through all that
I’m like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride ’til I can’t no more

"""Old Town Road""-----LYRICS ))


You know what? I'm done, done, done

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

You can't tell me nothin'

Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her

Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'

I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
