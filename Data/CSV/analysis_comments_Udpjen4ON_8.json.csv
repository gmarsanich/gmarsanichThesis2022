"Aww, such quiet and gentle triggers tonight 😌 Since black Alex isn't so bright, the emphasis is on your hands and triggers in this video. You did the lighting so good.Thank you for having the footage where I see you 😍 it's very important that you're on the video as well, not just the trigger assortment. But this mic definitely must be called, you decide that name. I was so waiting for your video, but I missed the premiere because you made the announcement late, and I was already asleep. The wooden slugs are amazing. It's a great video, thank you so much, Michael 🤩  Big hugs 🖤💗",0.991,Positive,0.20380952380952383,Netural,0.5801733136177063,Positive
