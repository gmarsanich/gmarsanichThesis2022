"LETRA:

As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom

"As he came into the window
Was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

"There are no music videos that have movie production money behind it. This is not a music video. It's a small production with big money. And it works. It was better than almost any movie for awards that year. 

We'll never have a jackson again.  And I feel sad for humanity. All he wanted was to be happy and content like all of us.",0.7783,Positive,0.025,Neutral,0.2341096550226211,Neutral

This is the best choreographed anything to ever exist. A close second being the zombie dance from thriller. Regardless of the man. His art was a cornerstone for civilization.  If there are ppl like David koresch. There are also ppl like Jackson. He gifted the world with new. And the more we liked it the more he gave. He is an icon. This video and its response proves it.,0.9132,Positive,0.4420454545454545,Positive,0.9189988970756532,Positive
