"Aceste adevărate talente și-au făcut loc printre nemuritori ! Jos pălăria ! Părerea mea este ca Freddie chiar dacă a avut o viata scurta , a avut una bună, chiar dacă nu ușoară ! Acest mare artist a murit din cauza ca era poponar , pentru ca a luat SIDA ulterior ! Și în ziua de azi se promovează homosexualitatea... Rușii nu au făcut bine ca au invadat Ucraina , doresc pace în lume și sa nu mai existe victime , dar pana la urma asa e în război... dar măcar rusii au fost împotriva homosexualilor ! Pana la urmă e treaba lor ce fac în viata privata , dar sa se gândească totuși cum a murit Freddie Mercury ... pentru ca pot sa sfârșească ca el ! Totuși chiar și cu acest viciu , eu îl consider unul dintre cei mai mari artiști din toate timpurile !",0.607,Positive,0.2963541666666667,Positive,0.6572253108024597,Positive

"Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, Lord
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!

"I never paid too much attention to the rock band Queen. So liked their songs but that's it. Then on biography I watched a documentary of Queen. I have since viewed every documentary I can get a hold of. I am in love with Freddy Mercury. Everything about him but mostly his fear of death and his worry over what we, his fans would think once we found out he was dying and what was killing him....wait for it....Freddy chose to tell us his big ugly secret 24 hours before his last breath and faced death head on by not taking an easier way. John Wayne explains courage as ""being scared as hell but saddling up anyway. Freddy to me has touched the hearts and minds of all walks.  Making his big ugly secret his big beautiful gift to us whom he loved so much. Please watch the last song he did on video. It is his message to us. May Freddy Mercury Rest in Peace for there is no judgment in the truth if you opt to not live a lie. Here's to truth.",-0.6088,Negative,0.0674641148325358,Positive,0.4836328029632568,Positive

I am a 40 year old father of 6. I have been through more in my 40 years than a good majority of the people i know. Life has taken many things and in that process i have become a hardened man....i consider myself to be strong....like a rock and not easily am i upset or do i get emotional.....that said....there is something about this song that makes me cry....pretty much every time i listen to it.....and for that ability to cut through the callous and scars and go right deep down into the very fibers of my heart this song is endearing to me on a level of no other,0.3536,Positive,0.2229993386243386,Positive,0.6247348189353943,Positive

"Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) Take a look in the mirror and cry (and cry)
Lord, what you're doing to me (yeah yeah)
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody (somebody) ooh somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones
At the end (at the end of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees)
And I start to pray
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody (somebody), ooh somebody
(Please) can anybody find me somebody to love?
Everyday (everyday) I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm going crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Ah, got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe in
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, Lord
Ooh somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
(Can anybody find me someone to love)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat (you just keep losing and losing)
I'm OK, I'm alright (he's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat (yeah yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
One day (someday) I'm gonna be free, Lord!
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love

Find me somebody, somebody (find me somebody to love) somebody, somebody to love
Find me, find me, find me, find me, find me
Ooh, somebody to love (Find me somebody to love)
Ooh (find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me somebody to love (find me somebody to love)
