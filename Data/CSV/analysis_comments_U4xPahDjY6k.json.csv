Yeah, I’m gonna take my horse to the old town road

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that’s black to match

Ridin’ on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche

You can’t tell me nothin’
Can’t nobody tell me nothin’

Hat down, cross town, livin’ like a rock star
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby’s got a habit:
Diamond rings and Fendi sports bras

Ridin’ down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I’ve been through all that
I’m like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride ’til I can’t no more

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match

Cowboy hat from Gucci
