"Interesting Fact
So, how'd an 18th-century composer sell more than pop music's greatest names? Well, in October 2016, the Universal Music Group released a box set commemorating the 225th anniversary of Mozart's death. Each disc included in the box set counted as one CD sold, and each set contained 200 discs. Throw in the proliferation of streaming—which has significantly dampened CD sales—and voila. Plus, the box set itself flew off shelves: As of this writing, there are only four remaining on Amazon ($686).",0.7003,Positive,0.3958333333333333,Positive,-0.3676765859127044,Negative

"But has anyone realised half the songs are missing? And there are so so many mistakes on the picture in the video like 2 23’s, someone you loved isn’t played, instead of a song by imagine dragons they’ve just put imagine dragons and that’s just 3 of them, there’s a lot more. I mean I suppose in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter but it’s not 40 songs on the playlist it’s like 17 or something.",0.9222,Positive,0.2172619047619047,Neutral,-0.4258430898189544,Negative
