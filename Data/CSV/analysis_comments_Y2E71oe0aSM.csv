If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now
Do you think of me?

Tell me, what are you dreamin'?

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try

I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Oh, yeah
I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more

"Lyrics : 

Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, want the good and the bad, everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Oh, yeah

I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm gonna love you, oh yeah(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I, I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

"Whoever is reading this, I wanted to say I hope you have a great day and that God loves you so much that he sent his son, Jesus,  to die on a cross for your sins and he rose again from the dead three days later. God Bless! ✝️🙏🏼⛪️

And also, He doesn’t want you to go to Hell but he wants you to go to Heaven with him but you have to be Saved. How do I get Saved you might ask? Here are the steps below on how to get Saved!

1. Confess to Jesus that you are a sinner and ask forgiveness for your sins.

2. Believe that God sent His son (Jesus) to die on a cross for your sins and that he rose again from the dead 3 days later.

3. Ask Jesus to come into your heart and your life and for him to be your Lord and Savior forever.

Does it make you dance
When you got twenty lands on the table?

Does it make you smile

But I’m gonna try
If it’s 10,000 mana or reducing your life
I choose Azusa

Oooh

Don’t you want to win?
See Day 2 begin?
No, I just wanna make more mana

Win a lot of games?
Make the Hall of Fame?
No, that’s not for me

When you close your eyes
Tell me what are you dreaming?
Everything I want to know it all

I’d spend 10,000 mana
And 10,000 more
I would cast Stonecoil Serpent for 10,000 for sure

And I might never get there
But I’m gonna try
If it’s 10,000 mana or reducing your life

Oooh
Fetching mountains and forests, plains, islands and swamps
Oooh
Sometimes only cycle this to draw a card

Get out.
