"Allah did not forbid music. This is a complete fabrication. There is no such ruling in the Holy Qur'an. Music is a wonderful gift from Allah to people. Those who want to discredit Islam fabricate such lies in the name of the Prophet Muhammad.

Аллах не запрещал музыку. Это полная выдумка. В Священном Коране такого постановления нет. Музыка - прекрасный дар от Аллах. Те, кто хочет дискредитировать ислам, используют имя Пророка Мухаммеда, чтобы сфабриковать такую ложь.

Allah no prohibió la música. Esta es una fabricación completa. No existe tal regla en el Sagrado Corán. La música es un regalo maravilloso de Allah para las personas. Aquellos que quieren desacreditar al Islam inventan tales mentiras en nombre del Profeta Muhammad.

Allah müziği yasaklamamıştır. Bu tamamen uydurmadır. Kutsal Kitabımız Kuranı-Kerim'de Allah'ın böyle bir emri yoktur. Müzik Yüce Allah'ın insanlara lütfettiği güzel bir nimettir. İslam'ı bilerekten gözden düşürmek isteyenler hz.Muhammed Peygamberin adını kullanarak böyle yalanlar uyduruyorlar.

لم يمنع الله الموسيقى. هذا تلفيق كامل. لا يوجد مثل هذا الحكم في القرآن الكريم. الموسيقى هدية رائعة من الله للناس. أولئك الذين يريدون تشويه سمعة الإسلام يختلقون مثل هذه الأكاذيب باسم النبي محمد.
