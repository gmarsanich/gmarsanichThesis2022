And I even heard that they upload up to 20 videos a day (not sure if that's true). But I mean that's ridiculous, but anyways it's a company so 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️. So if PewDiePie wants to defeat T-Series altogether I guess he just has to start his own company or bribe YouTube to delete their channel 😆😆😆 Just kidding.
But to defeat T-Series is a long journey I'm not sure he's willing to take. But anyways, whether you're a PewDiePie or T-Series fan, enjoy your viewing.😁😁😁
