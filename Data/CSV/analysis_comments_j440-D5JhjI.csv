"When I was at secondary school, at the end of each school year in the summer there was a creative festival ( for want of a better description ) when the different class years would come together to be creative in about 20 or less different activity groups which you could put your name down for. I once put my name down ( perhaps sadly ) for a group that made a medieval tapestry, other pupils who didn't put there names down were placed ( maybe at random ) into various groups that weren't filled up with names. In doing this group there was a tape player and these two younger lads than me played the tape 'Queen Live At Wembly' to which they were singing too. It was is a fine live album too! When they let me put my tape on of 50's and 60's music they ridiculed it, and they really didn't like the Everly's Brothers' track 'Let It Be Me' but in after thought, the band members of Queen were and are probably massive Everly Brothers fans! I am almost certain this is the case and I think Brian May paid tribute to the Everly's when Don Everly died not too long ago. One day some new wave highly popular music act may be listened too and Queen maybe old hat, but that new pop / rock legend may have been deeply inspired by Queen.",0.8917,Positive,0.0655918793849828,Positive,0.5323172211647034,Positive

The day will dawn of sanity (Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
