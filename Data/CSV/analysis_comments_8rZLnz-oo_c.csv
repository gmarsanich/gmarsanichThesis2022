"TL,DR at the bottom!


Honestly it's...

I really do think that maybe he wasn't completely thinking that it would be used inappropriately, the fanbase at the time was really just a bunch of 7-10/11 year olds, especially with Gachaverse and Gacha Studio, most of us were even younger depending on when we picked it up.

I think that what he added wasn't inherently sexual nor bad, considering how before Gacha Heat was like a whole thing, people had used that to be funny and stupid. I do however feel like he was too late to take them out and stop the behavior before it escalated, and it seems like even if he had gotten to the 'party' sooner, it would have continued as both Gacha haters and 7 years olds will just make they're characters the colors of the rainbow to get they're fix.


TL,DR: Hindsight is 20/20, but not everything can be accounted for all the time when it seems relatively harmless.

Edit: Now that I post the comment and look at it, it doesn't really need a TL,DR but oh well-",0.8185,Positive,0.0633333333333333,Neutral,0.3413947522640228,Positive
