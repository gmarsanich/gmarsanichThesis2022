"Actual lyrics:
¡Ay!
Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (oh)
Hey yeah
Diridiri, dirididi Daddy
Go!
Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy (DY)
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy
Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)
Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)
Despacito (yeh, yo)
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito (yo)
Deja que te diga cosas al oído (yo)
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito (yeh)
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito (hey yeah, yeah)
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh no)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (eh-oh) (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)
Despacito

"Lyrics:
Enderdragon in my direction
Many XP it's such a blessing, yeah
Use all the XP to enchant my armor, yeah
Oh-oh, I
Try to sleep on the darkest day
But the mobs are in the way
Gotta kill them so I can go to bed (bed)
This armor's really comfy when I put it on
Change it to peaceful so I'm not killed when I spawn
I see a village that is near
The only sounds I wanna hear
Are the villagers when I trade them some gear
Smelt the iron so I can get some metal
Make an Iron Pickaxe to mine the rare ores
You know that I gotta mine all these diamonds
Oh yeah (yeah)
Need alot of food on this hard adventure
Should I cook the pig or the cow?
I'm not sure
Maybe I should make a cake for my hunger
Minecraftcito
Where you need to survive all day and all night
Craft a diamond sword so you can fight
Place a torch in a cave to produce some light
Minecraftcito
Kill the creeper before it blows my house
But it blew up so I gotta move out
Don't have food so I'm fishing to catch a trout
Killing people in Hunger Games to get the victory
Trolling people on some servers
Lava their house 'cause I'm a griefer
(I'm a griefer, I'm a griefer baby)
Taming wolves with my bones 'cause I need lots of help
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them
To make survival you need armor bro
A pickaxe and a wooden how
Diamond sword but do not show
Don't flex on these haters bro
Make a farm and a house so creepers won't kill you
Go to the nether but don't hit pigmen
They will kill you
Get a lot of blaze powder and make the Eye of Ender
Find the Ender portal and put the eyes in the frames
After that, grab your bow and diamond sword
Yeah, don't hide that
You are one step away from completing Minecraft
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
See a witch in a swamp
Ocelot on top
Of a tree I'm gonna feed it some fish
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
Use a boat to travel to different places
Skeletons attacking me
Gotta make a base oh, yeah
Minecraftcito
Where you need to survive all day and all night
Craft a diamond sword so you can fight
Place a torch in a cave to produce some light
Minecraftcito
Kill the creeper before it blows my house
But it blew up so I gotta move out
Don't have food so I'm fishing to catch a trout
Killing people in Hunger Games to get the victory
Trolling people on some servers
Lava their house 'cause I'm a griefer
(I'm a griefer, I'm a griefer baby)
Taming wolves with my bones
'Cause I need lots of help
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them
Minecraftcito
This is how we do it down in the mineshaft
I just wanna hear you say, ""I love Minecraft""
See a creeper you know I gotta strike that (you know)
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
See a witch in a swamp
Ocelot on top
Of a tree I'm gonna feed it some fish
Exploring, exploring
To some other biomes
We're at another place
Changing up the timezones
When these mobs try to kill me
My doggies can attack them

But the mobs are in the way
Gotta kill them so i can go to bed (bed)
This armor is really comfy when i put it on
Change it to peaceful so im not killed when i spawn
I see a village that is near
The only sounds i wanna hear:
Are the villagers when i trade them some gear
Smelt, smelt the iron so i can get some metal
Make an iron pickaxe so i can mine the rare ores
You know that ive gotta mine all these diamonds
