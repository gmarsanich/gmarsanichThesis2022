"Ex-BTS trainee’s message to BTS 💜

BTS holds a special place in many peoples’ hearts. But for Kim Ji-hun, the seven-member act is more than just a record-breaking band to him. They were once his closest friends that he shared the best times of his life with. We talk to Ji-hun about his time as a K-pop trainee, memories with BTS and also how the experience has changed his life. Watch till the end for his message to BTS 💜

"I got to see PSY in downtown Seoul back in 2012. Standing in a crowd of 80,000 Koreans listening to Gangnum Style was an awesome experience. They LOVE their artists! A month later I won tickets to see Big Bang in Manila! I had bought a Samsung phone and my name was automatically entered into a draw. Another hugely enjoyable show. I've watched dozens of Korean TV series and movies (unlike many I don't mind reading subtitles - I even watch some English programs using subtitles). My connection to Korea? Watching every episode of M.A.S.H., and also on a serious note it was the fact my father had served with the Canadian Army during the Korean War. It was an honour to visit the War Memorial and Museum in Seoul.",0.9203,Positive,0.2546296296296296,Netural,0.544780969619751,Positive
