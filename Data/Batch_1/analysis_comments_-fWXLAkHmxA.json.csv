"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You
don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made
all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin. 
We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before
a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your
sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good.
The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly
Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t
keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by
his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not.
Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your
sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your
faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised
from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace
eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                    .               , ,                                                               .,                  ,.  ,. ., . ,.",0.9853,Positive,0.4954545454545455,Positive,0.7715029120445251,Positive
