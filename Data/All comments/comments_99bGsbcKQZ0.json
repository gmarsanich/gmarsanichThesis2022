If ASAP ROCKY and Rihanna have an OPEN RELATIONSHIP, him being with other women is not cheating, because they have an understanding and he's free to do whatever he wants to, as long as he is DISCRETE and RESPECTFUL about it.

Then if your music fails, you are still signed to the Label and can't release any music unless they authorize it...if they don't authorize it, then your career is basically over.

Body policing is a slippery slope to pushing a r*pe culture narrative that makes it socially acceptable to ignore bodily autonomy of human individuals on the basis of \"real\" vs \"fake\" faces/bodies which then perpetuates pretty privilege. On a side note,  I have all the best wishes for Rihanna and her family but let's not forget that she's not a saint either, and has been caught up in body shaming scandals including body shaming Kendall Jenner when Kendall was still an underage minor and a very adoring fan of Rihanna.

I don't see anything wrong w/ what Ariana Grande is doing. The Asian culture (K-Pop) is huge right nah. Why not capitalize off of it? The Asian consumer is typically very loyal. If Ariana can make calculated moves and market herself to that demographic then mo' power to her. Sh¡t, multiple fan bases translates to multiple streams of income. Music is just too much of a gamble nowadays, especially for black artists. I've gone on record plenty of times stating that artists should leave music alone and branch off into other platforms. I'm in the '90s demographic and history shows that folks my age (36) and older are not interested in supporting new music, especially from '90s artists. Our priorities and tastes have changed over the past 15 - 20 years. Some of us are starting new businesses, purchasing homes, creating families, etcetera. We're not the little girls waiting around for Usher Raymond's newest LP anymore. That time has passed. And guess what? It's not right or wrong. He didn't do anything wrong and we didn't do anything wrong. That's life. The music industry is always looking and booking ahead for fresh, new talent. While Usher Raymond was on top of the world, Christopher Brown was right behind about to do the same thing. That's just how it works. Nobody remains number one forever. Hell, Mr. Michael Jackson was indeed the \"King of Pop\" and we all know what happened to him. Even he couldn't rely on music because by the time he was in the clear, the bubblegum pop invasion had already begun. It's a corporate decision. Anyway, I'm glad artists are thinking ahead and starting new businesses. Do you know that there are still a handful of fans waiting around for Dr. Dre to release another _Chronic_ LP? I'm like, \"If y'all don't go someplace w/ that.\" That man ain't thinkin' about no doggon music. Trip though... Would you rather sell $100 headphones (which is a guaranteed sale) or sell $12 music that probably won't get sold, much less heard? 10,000 consumers purchase $100 headphones - you do the math. Most artists make $0.12 per LP sold , after recoupment. If you write then I believe that's $1 to $2 more. 10,000 consumers purchase $12 LPs - you do the math. Nah, no platform is always 100% smooth sailing, but DAMN! Dr. Dre raked in the cash w/ his earphones business. Ms. Rihanna Fenty struck gold w/ her cosmetics line. Mainstream cosmetic lines are indeed a guaranteed sale. Rihanna probably doesn't wanna be boppin' around the stage and promoting music that's gonna be forgotten within a month's span. Darnell Jones and Johnathan Buck released a song back in 2019 entitled, _Understand._ They released that song as a tester to see where the fans' heads were at. And of course they didn't support it. Why bother w/ a full body of work when fans won't even buy a $1.99 single? Eric Benét is doing movies because he knows that the fans don't and won't support his music, independently. Same thing goes for Clifford Smith Jr. (Method Man). Artists would be fools if they waited around for the fans to buy they music. They'd legit end up in the po' house. Anything you give away for free will come back around and fuck you up. A lot of artists see the bigger picture nowadays.

She really shouldn't be nip tucking her face. I would like to think it's great make up work. It is possible, isn't it?  I mean Oprah's makeup artist is a genius. Chloe is correct about the music industry. It has been going on forever.  It's another American system that needs to be dismantled. I am an advocate for artists receiving mad money for their creations. Artists should all endeavor to be independent recording under the umbrella of a label that is not trying to steal everything they produce. Fans want to see their favorites perform. They shouldn't have to work themselves to death doing it. The one percent are so effing greedy. They structure everything to their benefit. The rest of us just sit around and act as though we are powerless to do something about how the one percent operate. Too many good artists are struggling, and it should not be that way. Your comment about Rihanna choosing better resonates with me. It was the exact sentiment I had the first time I heard she was with ASAP. When she got pregnant, I felt pain. Ugh! It wasn't good news to me. I knew of him prior to Rihanna getting with him. I don't know his upbringing. He impresses me as being thuggish. I get a sense that he is not a decent person. Many of us do like bad boy, edgy types usually to our disappointment. I can't say if he loves her or not. Maybe he loves what she has built. Loyalty doesn't seem to be a character trait he possesses.

Love both of them, no hate.", "I was hovering my mouse over the bottom bar and I thought Ariana was Jeannie Mai from that little picture", "The whole internet believed a false rumour from a RANDOM twitter account, the cheating allegations were false. WHY would we now believe this random instagram user claiming she was hiding from RIHANNA, girl bye ! You wish you were that relevant chile !!", "I really wish ppl would stop bothering with Rihanna while she is pregnant, why wish her to be stressed? We don’t know if she wants to put that energy on her or if she even is stressed over this man. Leave this pregnant woman alone y’all.", "I agree he might have done somethings in the past but why bring them now!!!\nThose say she should leave him,name five people who are saints,who don't have any stains on them!!!\nShe knows his downs and said she has the whole world when by his side💯💯💯\nY'all save your advises for y'all relationships,this keeps happening to Chris, everytime he's dropping new music so shit pops up..if y'all kbe how manipulative this industry is then y'all wouldn't be this judgemental!!!!", "The most messed up part about Rocky and Rihanna situation—- when he was only dating her nothing happened and no news came out about him. The minute he got her pregnant….awwww ish here’s comes trouble, \nMegan the Stallion rumors\nAmina rumors \nComing from Barbados incident \nNow…another incident that has the police raiding his home 🤦🏾‍♀️\n\n\nSomeone in the industry isn’t too happy with Rocky and Rihanna having a baby😂😂. I saw a comment about Drake doing all this cause he’s salty 💀💀💀 … I know they’re kidding but that was funny af", "That hook up story sounds fake asl", "Ariana is like looking at Lil Kim. Messing with her face too much!", "I find it so disturbing how all these girls wanna come out and say they slept with rocky like they get points or something when in reality their just as nasty as him sleeping with a man who is obviously in a relationship 😫 nah that doesn't sit right with me", "Lol she doesn't look like Ariana at all. She's Italian??? Honestly thought she's black", "I don’t understand why Chloe and Halle didn’t continue to be independent artist. Now she’s stuck in a contract that’s only making them pennies. Def have to come out with a clothing line, or some type of brand deal AWAY from Beyoncé and Parkwood….\n\nAri do look Asian but she’s marketing herself to what’s trending…Asian culture is it. People will still invest because it’s her 🤷🏾‍♀️.", "The Media is stressing RiRi", "Skip advert 2:14 for Ariana Grande story.", "Positive attracts negative 🤦🏾‍♀️", "Rihanna, Kanye and Tyler The Creator where ahead of the game, the music industry is just out to exploit the artists and the only people making money from streaming are the streaming companies. I feel for Doja she needs to expand her brand beyond music", "I never thought Artists would make any money out of streams. To me, streaming these songs/artists that i truly love, has been a way to give them more exposure and making them more \"available\" or easier to others to find these amazing artists.", "Wat is shocking is that Ari is good with her body n doesn't have boobs or butt n is comfortable in her skin, but to alter ur face completely is a whole another situation. Nicki Manaj pointed this out on Joe budden years ago that touring is the only money making area, even streams she literally said they need to have thousands of streams  to make one dollar n I remember Joe budden arguing wit her about this topic n she broke it down completely. Even selling CD n Tapes they made more money before Napster n celebs in acting n music literally said the internet, yes u can build a following, but u don't build a bag off music today by streams. The internet does the opposite n even keeping count on sales don't match wat they really are selling or doing after an album release. LAPD did a shotty investigation. I don't believe he shot anyone. He will have a lawsuit. The victim says he thinks he grazed him he claims they were now acquaintances. It's not adding up. I don't believe he cheated on RIRI nice try tho!", "Something is odd. Why is all of this stuff about cheating and allegedly shooting? Something just odd with it being so close to her due date", "Rocky does have a lot of red flags, nobody can deny that, however it’s concerning how much ppl STILL put Rihanna’s ex on a pedestal all because of his billionaire status, we don’t know a thing about this man other than his name and allegedly how much he has in his bank account, people don’t know how that relationship was or what type of person he is, not even enough to make assumptions and yet they act like it was her biggest lost, this type of money obsessed mentally is really sad, someone isn’t automatically a catch just bc they have money. Anyways at the end of the day I just wish Rihanna and her baby the best.", "New intro?", "Who cares.

Its looks off bc she already has that signature makeup with the cat eye now it looks over done. In a few months it will go away and she'll hopefully never do that again.", "I think it was actually smart of Ariana to start a makeup brand she has a distinct look and a signature style. I think she  should've even started it sooner perhaps during sweetener era or the album after that because she still had the ponytail and I feel like that's one of her most iconic looks. as long as an artist has a distinct style like Riri they should definitely step into the beauty industry", "Ariana looks the same to me 🤷🏾‍♂️", "Always heard my mother saying while growing up,\"You pick until you pick SH#T\".Applies to this Rihanna situation..From a billionaire to a man who goes by ASAP,not cute plus can't even match up to your drip?Riri,poor decision...Not all love should be taken seriously,this was one who should have been passed on....Never lik3d the match up...", "Why now?", "Yeah I think Rihanna settled.

There was radio silence till Rihanna and ASAP announced their joy. People are nasty", "lol, they be mad cause they need work done themselves.", "I just think people don't like to see other people win or happy because the timing of the asap rocky thing is very sus", "Me and Rih both got baby daddies that ain’t shit that’s my good sis frfr now", "I’m sorry it turned out that way but… I use to really like Asap and through his interviews and everything I always knew he would not be the type to settle down. After his relationship ended with the model Chanel. The way he talked about group adult fun with multiple ladies and all…👀 He just wouldn’t have been the one I would’ve chosen to build a family with but I pray it works out for her especially with the baby 🙏🏾", "The face is giving kimchi but the last name is giving carbonara. Come on, Ari. Stop the mess.", "I mean....asap is a sex addict so I'm not surprised 🤷🏾‍♀️", "People REALLY need to understand that just because Chloe (or anyone) PROFESSES to know God with their SPEECH, that doesn't mean that they are TRULY LIVING for Him with their ACTIONS and LIFESTYLE. Far too often in our culture, if a famous person just happens to mention \"God\" then it seems like everyone wants to label them as a \"Christian\" instead of really examining the person's CHARACTER and FRUIT....and that can be dangerous on so many different levels.\n\nChloe has DEFINITELY compromised her christian convictions (doing raunchy videos, using profanity, etc.), and has decided to make her CAREER the true lord of her life instead of Jesus and His ways. I hope she realizes that the Lord is worth more than anything that she can gain in Hollywood....and even though she has compromised and turned away from the ways of God, she can still repent, give her life to Jesus, and start taking a stand for His RIGHTEOUS ways. Jesus said, \"What does it profit a person if they gain the WHOLE WORLD but lose their OWN SOUL?\"\n\n\"For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. For she cares nothing about the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail and doesn’t realize it. So now, my sons, listen to me. Never stray from what I am about to say: Stay away from her! Don’t go near the door of her house! If you do, you will lose your honor and will lose to merciless people all you have achieved. Strangers will consume your wealth, and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor. In the end you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body.\" (Proverbs 5:3-11)", "She does look Asian 🤣", "it's funny how people went from saying ariana is finally white -> she's asianfishing using the same pictures as example. it just proves how yall just jump into the bandwagon. when ariana looked like this since a while and the only difference now is her cheek fillers and lip fillers. everything else looks the same. yall don't know how the Hollywood works and you're doing her management a favor with all these scandals. Keeping her name trending when she is doing NOTHING publicly at the moment.", "I agree when there's smoke there's fire, she chose to be with a bad boy", "wait so ariana probably dialed back on the fake tan prob because she was being accused of trying to look another race and now people are saying shes trying to look asian? i cant. shes done way way more for marginalized communities than 99% of people that are even close to her level of celebrity have and way earlier as well. and the pics used here were comparing her from 2016 (edited pics btw) to this year...... idk bout you but im in my early 20s and i look like a goddam different human since 2016 and i cant believe i ever dressed myself like i did back then. theres a lot of actually problematic people in the limelight so lets find something better to talk about k", "Been saying her face been changing from her lips but her fans hate to hear it 😂,", "YASSSSS CHLOE WAS SO GOOD ON TERRELL LAST NIGHT !!", "PREACH ARI", "It’s bloggers channels like this that makes stuff worse. How about just leaving stuff alone. If ASAP ROCKY did this crime months ago he should’ve been taken in for questioning, why wait so late? The public is making her pregnancy horrible, have some class and let them figure out their own problems to themselves, public figures or not. Everyday women go through much worse with their baby daddies, this is no different. No woman that pregnant should have any stress around her, celebrity or not.", "NEWWWWW INTRO !!!!!", "But for real I love RiRi but asap out of all people a sex addict and serial cheater☹️"]
