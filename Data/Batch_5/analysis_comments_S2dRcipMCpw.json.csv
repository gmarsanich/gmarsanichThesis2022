"H'algo no...

Há algo no ar agora
Como se eu 'tivesse sem noção do tempo
Meio que eu não ligo agora
E meio que está tudo bem

Tu nem estavas lá naquele dia
Estava à tua espera
Será que estavas longe aquele dia
Foi a gota d'água para mim
E eu sabia

Enviei-te flores
Ao menos ligaste?
Foste tomar banho

E as largou à escada

Pensei que fosses estável mas, cara, estava errada
Não és nada além duma causa perdida
E isso não é nada como uma vez fora
Sei que achas-te um fora-da-lei
Mas não tens emprego
Não és nada além duma causa perdida
E isso não é nada como uma vez fora
Sei que achas-te um fora-da-lei
Mas não tens emprego

Pensava que eras tímido
Mas talvez tu só não tinhas nada à mente
Talvez estavas pensando sobre ti mesmo a todo o tempo
Queria que tu fosses meu
Mas isso foi antes d'eu perceber
Alguém como ti, seria tão fácil de se achar
Tão fácil
Fácil

Não deste-me flores
Queria não me importar
Ficavas fora por horas
Podias estar em qualquer canto

Pensei que foste crescer eventualmente
Mas provaste-me o contrário
Não és nada além duma causa perdida
E isso não é nada como uma vez fora
Sei que achas-te um fora-da-lei
Mas não tens emprego
Não és nada além duma causa perdida
E isso não é nada como uma vez fora
Sei que achas-te um fora-da-lei
Mas não tens emprego

O que foi que eu te disse
Não acomoda-te
Agora é a hora de encarar
Agora, agora, agora, agora
O que foi que eu te disse
Não acomoda-te
Agora é a hora de encarar

And left them by the stairs
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ah, eh, eh

Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
I know you think you're such an outlaw

But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

I used to think you were shy
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time

I used to wish you were mine
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find

(So) So easy (So, so)
Eeh, hm, hm, hm, hm

Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Could be anywhere

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw

But you got no job
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

"March 5, 2022 I have seen WAP with Meagan Thee Stallion and Cardi B twerking [new concept to me, who is 68!], but on March 15, 2021, Billie apologized to Megan after Billie received the ""Record of the Year"" for ""Everything I Wanted"" - which, I believe, is beautiful and worthy of that award.   The ""Lost Cause Official Music Video"" came out June 2, 2021 with Billie twerking.  On Sept 15, 2021 Megan Thee Stallion wrote the tribute to Billie for TIME's  ""100 Most Influential People.""  I think this Video is an homage to twerking and Megan Thee Stallion.  I don't believe it enhanced the song at all.  The VEVO LIVE MUSIC VIDEO is terrific.  And Billie is a beautiful young woman as is manifest in other live videos as well - TWERKING may enhance and interpret the lyrics of some songs, but I don't think it did anything for ""Lost Cause"".  P.S.

"Something's in the-
Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losing track of time
Like I don't really care right now, but maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you
I wondered if you aware that day was the last straw for me and I know
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower and left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ay-ay-ay-ay, ay, ay
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
So easy (so easy)
He-hee, mm-mm-mm, mm
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd been gone for hours
Could be anywhere
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (yeah)
But you got no job
You ain't nothing but a lost cause
And this ain't nothing like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw (think you're such an outlaw)
But you got no job
What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now, na-na, na-na, na-na

"As someone who has been appreciating Billie's music since ""Ocean Eyes"" was released, its great to see her grow into her own, & showing off her divinely feminine curves.

She is (obviously) crazy talented, crazy beautiful, & from what I've observed it seems like she also has a genuinely kind soul.

That said, I do find it kinda funny that they/she went soo above & beyond ""PC"" for this vid; 

ie ""perfectly balanced diversity"" --

•2 black / dark skinned women, 
•2 latina / brown skinned women, 
•2 red/auburn haired light skinned women (perhaps of Eastern European ancestry?)..

All drop dead gorgeous of course (including her blonde self), just thought that was interesting. No intended negativity or judgement, simply an observation. 

In regards to the accusations of her ""queerbaiting"", 
as an older bi/queer leaning, non conforming cis woman of color myself 
I'm not totally sure I know what that term (queerbaiting) actually means; 
HOWEVER,
to me it looks like she is simply growing & experiencing life, learning to be unabashedly comfortable in her own skin & having fun while doing so. 

I seriously don't understand how people can be mad at her for that.

There are much more important issues to be concerned about at the moment..soo many serious issues which urgently need to be focused on & attended to.

Billie seems to be happy & if so I am truly happy for her & wish her a lifetime full of love, happiness, meaning & fulfilment.

They just cant help not showing every inch of themselves to the world for attention. I bet she let down the girls that looked up to her for being how she used to be.
