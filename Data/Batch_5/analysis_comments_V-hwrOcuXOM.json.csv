"Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You
don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made
all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin. 
We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before
a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your
sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good.
The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly
Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t
keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by
his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not.
Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your
sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your
faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised
from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace
eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                         /,../,/.,/.,/.,/.,                ,/.,/. ,/      /.,/./,",0.9853,Positive,0.4954545454545455,Positive,0.7468827962875366,Positive

") A forum entitled “China—Forced Organ Harvesting and the Chinese Communist Party” took place at the Press Club Brussels Europe on October 27, 2021. As part of the day’s events, Falun Dafa practitioners were invited to demonstrate the exercises at a local park before the forum began.


Practitioners demonstrate the Falun Dafa exercises.

The forum was organized by Gary Cartwright, publishing editor of the London-based media EU Today, and Andy Vermaut, a member of The International Alliance for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms and a human rights advocate.

There were seven speakers, including Edward McMillan-Scott, former vice-president of the European Parliament; Hamid Sabi, counsel to the China Tribunal and human rights lawyer; David Matas, Canadian international human rights lawyer; Harold King, deputy director of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH); Andy Vermaut; Kayan Wang, spokesperson for Falun Gong in Holland; and Manel Msalmi, president of the European Association for The Defense of Minorities.

I bought such a knife on AliExpress (it didn’t even say it is an automatic one ie illegal) and Police came knocking (4 of them with a doggo) because of my attempt to illegally import weapons into the country. I had to come in for questioning and it went to the DA’s office. They actually tried to prosecute me. Lucky I got a lawyer and was able to prove not knowing this was an automatic weapon (not knowingly imported). I live in Switzerland. I hope the law is more gentle on you Pewds ❤️,-0.4417,Negative,0.07441077441077441,Netural,-0.569871187210083,Negative
