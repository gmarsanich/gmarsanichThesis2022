I loved this. Coming from someone whom has 6 tattoos YOU definitely need to choose something that has absolute 💯% true meaning to you. You LOVE makeup so pick something that is makeup themed (Nikki Tutorials is one whom can help you with that 💜). You LOVE your fur babies so you can get a dog paw print with thier names on it. 1 name above it and the other name below it. You LOVE your family so you can just plainly have your last name tattooed on you to represent everyone in it. And the very obvious one... instead of isters 🤣🤣 just do Sisters in a beautiful cursive font. 💜💜💜,0.9953,Positive,0.2329081632653061,Netural,0.8629292845726013,Positive

"Okay for the Tattoo I would say don’t think so much into it. Also start with places people wont see immediately. If you are still unsure start with a small one and then go up. Also don’t bind too much meaning into your tattoos, I would say do it more for the art of it. Of course, you can also have a couple with meanings, but not all of them have to be! One last point, as soon as you did your first, you will get obsessed with doing more!! ☺️",0.6388,Positive,0.20069444444444443,Netural,0.8710375428199768,Positive
