Since August 26, 2017 I have remained discreet because I wanted to resolve this issue without anyone knowing. This post is not for fame or anything like that, but definitely for the truth to come out and clarify things.
Billboard published the first news about the lawsuit that I, Newton Canga (My Partner) filed against Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee for having used my DESPACITO composition without my authorization and having made changes to my lyrics to hide plagiarism. The corruption in this dirty business covers the truth with money, and due to little resources, I had to litigate this case without a lawyer. I had to let all the impostors involved in this case know where the story of this expression came from.
To the court I presented the registration of the song Despacito, which was registered in 2006 with the library of Congress. I presented my DIARY ... one of my notebooks from 2009 where I wrote about the people who wanted to arrange my song and who are connected with Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Zuleyka Rivera, the female lead of the music video. In addition, I submitted photographs and specific dates that show how these impostors had access to my work. Few of you will enter the judicial page (PACER), and read the motions full of arguments explaining what happened, but here I leave the case number (1: 19-cv-22813) for those who want to investigate further.
The non-Spanish speaking judge wrongly implied that I am litigating this case because of the title of both songs. I must emphasize that although the titles and other elements are not protected by the copyright law, it is a lot of coincidence that both works have this amount of similarities that you will see below.
1] The same title and theme [2] Root of the same genre (Rap - Reguetton / Pop - Reguetton) [3] Vulgar words are not used in both lyrics [4] The word Despacito is used almost in the same amount: ( Plaintiff = Nine, Defendants = Ten) [5] The total number of words used is roughly the same (Plaintiff = 457, Defendants = 453) [6] SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS GROUPED IN THE CHORUS AREA AND SIMLAR MODIFICATIONS IN THE LAST CHORUS OF BOTH SONGS [7] Too many similar expressions scattered in the stanzas [8] The length of both songs in MP3 format is approximately the same (Plaintiff = 3:50, Defendants = 3:48 [9] Expressions written by me (plaintiff), which They were not said by the defendants, but they were shown in the music video that already has 6.9 Billion views.
Consequently, if the court had analyzed in detail both compositions as a whole, it would have identified the existence of a real problem for the trial. The judge on August 11, 2020 closed the case arguing that ""the works are only similar in terms of unprotected elements and do not share any similarity in the level of protectable expression."" She never argued about the 17 USC 101 code which clearly explains how my chorus area is protected by copyright law by me pointing out the same choice of words grouped in the defendant's chorus.
The words used in my chorus and the defendant's chorus are naturally not supposed to flow into a ""specific area"", in this case the heart of both songs (the chorus). Title 17 of the United States Code, section 101, explains that ""copyright may protect an author's original contribution to a compilation of unprotected elements,"" specifically, the original way in which the author has selected, coordinated and ordered the elements of his work. ""
In other words; ""The defendants are free to use the same elements in the public domain, as long as they are not selected and ordered in the same way."" (Now I ask !!); After I used my love letters and elements from my other 2 songs to complete the full expression of my song Despacito, how is it possible that 3 composers (Defendants) have concluded with elements similar to mine in the chorus area? When a LOT OF ELEMENTS are seen in the same area of 2 compositions, and those words, however brief, create the same situation, this cannot be considered a coincidence, especially when there is evidence that clearly shows with dates and photos how the accused had access to my composition.
I used approximately 457 words and the defendant 453. How is it possible that only in the CHORUS, which is the heart of both compositions, Luis Fonsi, Erika Ender and Daddy Yankee have placed the same words that I select to give life to my choir? ? The 17 USC 101 code protects my expression regardless of how common the words I group and select to build my chorus area. Luis Fonsi himself admitted that Despacito is a song that he felt he had heard before. Look on youtube >>> How I wrote that Song: Luis Fonsi ""Despacito"" https://youtu.be/E6W-7trFIsI
It is common practice that arranger pirates never copy a song word for word. The 12 elements that are in the zone of both chorus and that are forming the same scene, should have been enough to demonstrate plagiarism in this case. There was no song that the court or the defendants could track down, and that the chorus area will use the amount of elements that I and the defendants are using in the chorus. Case closed can be opened, but if the court had been more diligent and considered my proof of access and then scrutinized the chorus of both compositions, the case would not have been closed.",0.9882,Positive,-0.017806799336650088,Negative,-0.5368401408195496,Negative

"Comin' over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh-oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me tailor-made, love how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verso 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
¡Oh! Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (Oh, yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)


[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Verso 2: Daddy Yankee]
Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo, yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo, mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empecemos lento, después salvaje

[Pre-Coro: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber, Daddy Yankee]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
¡Oye!

[Coro: Justin Bieber & Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee]
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
(Sube, sube, sube
Sube, sube)

[Post-Coro: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo, quiero ser tu ritmo (Woah, woah)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (Woah, woah)
Tus lugares favoritos (Favorito, favorito, baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (Woah, woah)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Woah, woah)
Y que olvides tu apellido

[Puente: Luis Fonsi]
Despacito
This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!""
I can move forever cuando esté contigo
¡Báilalo!

[Post-Coro: Daddy Yankee, Luis Fonsi & Justin Bieber]
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
