I’m gonna try not to go into big details so you don’t have to read my life story but I had a question.\n\nSo, I’m young(don’t know why you need to know that but at the time of writing this I’m hiding in a bathroom stall at 9:42 am during 1st period), in middle school, and I gotten a few ideas…for games! Their all still in progress and I have not..started….actually working on THE game..but I got my ideas! One I think you’ll enjoy is going to be called “Stealing In The Moonlight” or it may change because now the name doesn’t make too much sense..OH! How about: “Late Night Moon”? Uh..idk, someone in this comment section can find this, read it and help with a name based on the idea.\n\nIn the meantime I’ll use it’s original name. “Stealing In The Moonlight” is this game where you basically work in an office-(pause. Time check: 12:06 am, 3rd period, same bathroom stall I’m hiding in. Continuing!)-with your pal Tom.(Tom what? No one knows! I’m lazy so it’ll forever be a mystery.)Tom is HUGE nerd for the supernatural/paranormal, aliens, etc. and has recently found something that peeked his interest.\n\nWhile working, Tom found out this old animatronic made a comeback in the worst way possible. Guess what it does? It starts murdering kids and adults a like.(starting to sound like a bad ripoff of FNAF) It’s name is “Fuzzy Cuddler”-(Time check: 3:18 and I’m sitting on the sideway)-he was originally made for children’s entertainment-(as we all know, an animatronic made for kids goes perfectly well! We seen how FNAF worked out, so this one must work out just as better!)-until he had a bit of an accident-(time check…8:17 am, next day. Friday to be exact cause I’m not sure when I’ll drop this in the comments.)(Man, I suck at making sure to continue letters. Anyways, time check:  10:25, second period)-with a little boy who decided to get a closer look.(Fnaf has taught us that it’s always good to go near animatronics.)\n\nAfter that little accident the company that owned Fuzzy Cuddler and his little attraction shut down and threw him out back, unaware that the animatronic had a mind of it’s own and decided to go on a killing spree. Tom, this dumb idiot, decided it’d be a GREAT idea to try and catch this thing and show everyone what a monster it’s become or something. You don’t remember the details, you were trying to work.(Time check..again: 12:11, third period)You, having a horrible job, decided to come and join him.\n\n(GOD, okay. March 5th, Saturday, 7:35 pm) I’d really enjoy if, whenever this games demo comes out or whenever the FULL game comes out, you’d check it out! It’d really mean a lot to me!
