"My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important

But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball

Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing

Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
I was patient, yeah, oh
I was patient, aye, oh
Now I can scream that we made it
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now, I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead, I'm in the trap though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
You know what I'm on, aye
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye
My momma called, seen you on TV, son

Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
You know what I'm on, aye
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it

"Your depiction of whom we call the Cleaners or 'C' is IT! They have worked selflessly overtime all over Earth, especially inside Asian areas like Korea since 2015 to help with the purge, but, inside your industry as well. Thank you for channeling them and writing this song.  It's a favorite of the Human C's. They see it as one of many tributes to their work...they are Human foot soldiers, life is lonely for them and have a manufactured doppelganger for their protection and during down time they love to dance it out and we are extremely proud to say we've had zero C casualties this far in the purge. Congratulations to you Post.

"YO! 
Congratulations!!!...I'm here just over 5 years later REFLECTING on how MUCH amazing music and hard work Post has done. He's very humble but can we just pause for a second and realize that it's been years since Post was in the common rap stratosphere? He immediately went to outerspace and it's been all gas no brakes ever since. I don't know how he does it & I hope he remembers to take time for himself. I'd like to see Post around for the rest of my life because besides making good music he's just a real and comforting person to hear from. Even if any person had been offered a  handful of the things that Post has actually done I imagine they would be burned out and truly realize how much work goes into it. I think people often just see the success and leave the roses on the doorstep as a foregone conclusion. I'm here to give some roses while Post is here and I am here on this earth to do it. 

This comment will merely scrape the surface as a sample of a much larger platter of things Post has done and what he's shared with the world. I'm no stan yet I just gotta appreciate this man. One day he was just a guy on Soundcloud with braids and now reflecting years on he's worked with so many artists from so many industries beyond just music; working with legends of rap to rock & more, having the Motley Crew video with NASCAR for Lyrical Lemonade, having his Budweiser dreams come true, getting a deal with Jaegermeister, working with Nintendo for Pokemon's Anniversary and being animated & performing IRL to be recreated digitally as an avatar of himself, working with Swae Lee to make Sunflower for Spider-Man: Into The Spiderverse soundtrack, touring around the world and seeing so much that I can't even imagine ever even touching. I'd love to spend a day with Post Malone just chilling on a low key perfect day where he just does whatever he wants to do without worry. To just be a part of that at my old ass age of 33 would be a miracle; totally surreal dream come true. Still I enjoy imagining it. They say never meet your idols but Post isn't my idol. I look at him as a man that's like anyone else who just happens to be amazing at making music. It's really not the riches of Post's life that I'm jealous of; it's really just his sense of confidence, his work ethic, making things look effortless when he's doing so much without complaining or tooting his horn about it. People always saying dumb stuff about Post and I don't get it but why care about any of it. Just like what you like and do you. I feel blessed to know Post Malone even as a fan. If I met Post IRL I feel like it would be like meeting up with an old friend from another lifetime. Just spending a boring day with Post is my dream. If music was involved that would be so dope. I just want to see this man before I die. 

Thanks Austin! I'm so happy to see your continued success and how you have walked your path with grace & an open mind. You deserve all the love you get and although I'm just a random fan writing from a room in the Chicago suburbs on my laptop still in my pajamas I'm just here to leave some digital roses while there's a possibility you might see them. Are you picturing roses in your head? Are they red roses? I thought so. Whatever the case may be you are a brother to me in a sense and I'm poking through this screen to say Congratulations!

"Lyrics 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah
Mm-mmm
Yeah
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look, we made it
Yeah, we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
Now I'm jumping out the Bentley, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
But I know I had to have it, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I be itching like a addict, yeah
I'm surrounded, twenty bad bitches, yeah
But they didn't know me last year, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
I was patient, yeah, oh
I was patient, aye, oh
Now I can scream that we made it
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
Young nigga, young nigga, graduation
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
I'm looking for someone to call, baby
But right now, I got a situation
Nothing but old Ben-Ben Franklins
Big rings, champagne
My life is like a ball game
But instead, I'm in the trap though
Pot so big, call it Super Bowl
Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
Top-floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post
Malone, I got a play on my phone, aye
You know what I'm on, aye
Huncho Houdini is gone, aye
My momma called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
They said I wouldn't be nothing
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
Yeah, we made it
